However, the solution does not directly provide the value of <missing 1>, so we will have to infer it from the rest of the solution.\n\nThe solution then proceeds to prove that primes work and composites do not work. We will focus on the part that proves primes work.\n\nThe solution states that if <missing 2> is prime, then we can assign a monomial <missing 4> to each cell with integer $k$. The sum of the monomials is <missing 5>, where the LHS is obtained by summing over all cells and the RHS is obtained by summing over all rows.\n\nLooking at the formulae, we can see that <expression 1> x \\in S matches the tag <missing 1>, as it is related to the set $S$ of $p$ th roots of unity that are not $1$.\n\nThe solution then states that the LHS of the above equivalence vanishes over $S$ and the RHS is <missing 6>.

Looking at the formulae, we can see that <expression 10> n=ab matches the tag <missing 10>.\n\nThe solution then states that each $d_i$ must be $p$, so each row represents a single residue $\\pmod{p}$.

Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to prove that some integer appears infinitely many times in the sequence. If not, then the sequence contains arbitrarily large integers. The first time each integer larger than M appears, it is followed by a 1. So 1 appears infinitely many times, which is a contradiction.\n\nNext, we need to prove that every integer x \u2265 M appears at most k times. If not, consider the first time that any x \u2265 M appears for the third time. Up to this point, each appearance of x is preceded by an integer which has appeared x \u2265 M times. So there must have been at least M numbers that have already appeared at least M times before x does, which is a contradiction.\n\nThus, there are only finitely many numbers that appear infinitely many times. Let the largest of these be k. Since k appears infinitely many times there must be infinitely many integers greater than M which appear at least k times in the sequence, so each integer gth also appears infinitely many times. Since hth doesn't appear infinitely often there must only be finitely many numbers which appear more than k times. Let the largest such number be a_n.\n\nFrom here on, we call an integer x big if x > l, medium if l \u2265 x > k, and small if x \u2264 k.\n\nTo summarise, each small number appears infinitely many times in the sequence, while each big number appears at most k times in the sequence. Choose a large enough N' such that a_{N'} is small, and in N': every medium number has already made all of its appearances; every small number has made more than max(k, N) appearances.\n\nSince every small number has appeared more than k times, past this point each small number must be followed by a big number. Also, by definition each big number appears at most k times, so it must be followed by a small number. Hence the sequence alternates between big and small numbers after a_{N'}.\n\nNow, let's analyze the subsequence of small numbers. We need to prove that this subsequence is eventually periodic with period at most k.\n\nTo do this, we define a function p_n to be the smallest number such that a_{n+p_n} = a_i is also small for some i with i > n. In other words, a_{n+p_n} = a_i is the first small number to occur twice after n.\n\nWe need to prove that p_n, p_{n+2}, p_{n+4},... is a nondecreasing sequence bounded above by k. If not, then p_n < p_{n+2} for some n. By the definition of p_n, a_{n+p_n} = a_i is the first small number to occur twice after n. Since p_n < p_{n+2}, a_{n+p_n} = a_i is also the first small number to occur twice after n+2. But this contradicts the definition of p_{n+2}.\n\nTherefore, p_n, p_{n+2}, p_{n+4},... is a nondecreasing sequence bounded above by k.

The claim states that if $n$ has at least $2$ prime divisors, WLOG let $p$ and $q$ be the smallest two of these primes, then the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the solution step by step.\n\n1. The first step is to prove the claim. We need to show that the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the possible values of the divisors. We know that $p$ is the smallest prime that divides $n$, so it is the smallest divisor not equal to $1$. Therefore, the first two divisors are $1$ and $p$.\n\nNext, we need to find the smallest divisor of $n$ that is not equal to a power of $p$. We claim that this divisor is equal to $q$. To prove this, we need to consider the possible values of the divisors.\n\nLet's consider the case where $n$ has at least $2$ prime divisors. We know that $p$ and $q$ are the smallest two prime divisors of $n$. We need to show that the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$.\n\nWe can start by considering the possible values of the divisors. We know that the first two divisors are $1$ and $p$. We need to find the smallest divisor of $n$ that is not equal to a power of $p$.\n\nLet's consider the case where $z$ is a prime different from both $p$ and $q$. We know that $z$ is larger than $q$, since $q$ and $p$ are the smallest two prime divisors of $n$. Therefore, the divisor is larger than $q$.\n\nNext, we need to consider the case where $z$ is not a prime. We know that all divisors divisible by $p^y$ are also larger than $q$, and otherwise are of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ or $p^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$.\n\nIf the divisor is of the form $p^x$, then it is a power of $p$. If it is of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$, the smallest of these factors is $q$. Therefore, the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $a=1$. We know that the condition fails, since $p^2$ does not divide $p+q$. Therefore, $a$ must equal $1$ for the condition to be satisfied in this case.\n\nHowever, we know that the ordered list of divisors satisfies $a\\geq 2$, meaning since the first $3$ divisors are $1$, $p$, and $p^2$, then the last $3$ divisors are $q$, $p^2+q$, and $n$. Therefore, $p^2$ must divide $p^2+q$. But $p^2$ is divisible by $p$, so $p^2+q$ must also be divisible by $p$. However, since $a=1$, $p^2$ is not divisible by $n$.\n\nWhen $n=p^2$, it is easy to verify that this works for all primes $p$ and all $q$, since $p^2$ divides $p+q$, and the divisors are ordered as $(1,\\,  p,\\,  q)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $n$ has only one prime divisor. We know that the condition is satisfied, since $p^2$ divides $p+p^2$.\n\nTherefore, the solution is that the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$.\n\nNow, let's match the formulae to the missing tags in the solution.\n\nWe can start by matching the formulae to the missing tags in the claim.\n\n*   <missing 1> is equal to $p$.\n*   <missing 2> is equal to $q$.\n*   <missing 3> is equal to $z$.\n*   <missing 4> is equal to $p^y$.\n*   <missing 5> is equal to $q$.\n*   <missing 6> is equal to $(\\frac{n}{q})$.\n*   <missing 7> is equal to $q^2$.\n*   <missing 8> is equal to $p^a$.\n*   <missing 9> is equal to $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2\u2026\\,  p^x)$.\n*   <missing 10> is equal to $x\\geq 2$.\n*   <missing 11> is equal to $(\\frac{n}{p} + n)$.\n*   <missing 12> is equal to $a\\geq 2$.\n*   <missing 13> is equal to $n=p^x$.\n*   <missing 14> is equal to $\\frac{n}{p} + n$.\n*   <missing 15> is equal to $p^{a-1}=p^0=1$.\n*   <missing 16> is equal to $p<q$.\n*   <missing 17> is equal to $\\frac{n}{p}$.\n*   <missing 18> is equal to $p^{x+1}$.\n*   <missing 19> is equal to $p^{a-1}$.\n*   <missing 20> is equal to $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2\\dots)$.\n*   <missing 21> is equal to $p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q$.\n*   <missing 22> is equal to $p^{a-1} \\nmid p^a + q$.\n*   <missing 23> is equal to $(1, p, q)$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23."]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.0598483}

We have a list of formulae in LaTeX format, and we need to identify which formula corresponds to each missing tag.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the solution and identifying the missing tags. We see that the solution involves finding the equation of circle <missing 3> and circle <missing 7>, and we need to use the formulae to find the values of <missing 4> and <missing 5>.\n\nLooking at the formulae, we see that <expression 4> vy+wz=0 and <expression 5> DI_BI_C. We can infer that <missing 4> is related to the equation of circle <missing 3>, and <missing 5> is related to the equation of circle <missing 7>.\n\nMoving on to the next missing tag, we see that we need to find the equation of the radical axis, which is given by <missing 9> with <missing 10>, <missing 11>, and <missing 12>. We can use the formulae to find the values of <missing 10>, <missing 11>, and <missing 12>.\n\nLooking at the formulae, we see that <expression 10> ux+vy+wz=0, <expression 11> DII_A, and <expression 12> \\overline{AD}. We can infer that <missing 10> is related to the equation of the radical axis, <missing 11> is related to the intersection of the radical axis with line <missing 13>, and <missing 12> is related to the equation of line <missing 13>.\n\nContinuing this process, we can match the formulae to the missing tags.

The solution states that the answer is <missing 1> only. This suggests that we need to find a formula that represents a single value or a specific condition.\n2. The solution mentions that each of the m blocks has a red bead count between 0 and n, each of which appears at most once, so m \u2264 n+1 is needed.

The solution mentions that the counts are all distinct (they are <missing 19> from bottom to top). This implies that we need to find a formula that represents the relationship between the counts and the rows.\n7. The solution describes a construction for another specific case, where the beads are listed in reading order as an array with <missing 21> rows and n columns. This suggests that we need to find a formula that represents the number of rows in the array.\n8. The solution mentions that the new construction still works for the same reason (the cyan beads do nothing for the first n+1-m shifts, then one reduces to the previous case).

Since the solution does not directly match any formula, we will come back to this later.\n\nThe second missing tag is <missing 2>. The solution states that <missing 2> is prime. This implies that <missing 2> is a prime number. We can match this with formula <expression 6>, which is \\boxed{\\text{prime } n}. This formula represents a prime number, so we can assign <expression 6> to <missing 2>.\n\nThe third missing tag is <missing 3>.

The solution states that f is either identically 0 or \\prod_{s \\in S} (x-s)=1+x+\\ldots+x^{p-1}. This implies that <missing 9> is the condition for f to be non-zero. We can match this with formula <expression 9>, which is \\prod_{s \\in S} (x-s)=1+x+\\ldots+x^{p-1}. This formula represents the condition for f to be non-zero, so we can assign <expression 9> to <missing 9>.\n\nNow, we can assign the remaining missing tag, <missing 1>. The solution states that the answer is all <missing 1>. We have already assigned <expression 6> to <missing 2>, which is \\boxed{\\text{prime } n}.
