An Indian convoy carrying a deadly weapon is ambushed and the soldiers guarding it are killed in the process. It works and the Karan Kavach is reactivated, averting the airstrike and a potential war. Misha and Rocky arrive in London and meet an IT Specialist named Parminder aka Pam, who is assigned to assist them in the mission. Meanwhile, the team infiltrate a London Subway in order to retrieve the stolen package. However, the man's wounds heal instantly and he flees the scene. Back to the present, Kabir reveals that he has cloned Azad and kills the real one. Feeling betrayed, Kabir decided to switch sides and sell the invention to India's enemies. He kidnaps Priya and leaves Freddy and Rocky to die. However, they ended up killing him and were court-martialed for not following orders, after which Freddy broke off his engagement with Priya. However, the masked man and his army take Priya hostage and following a sustained chase, the group are cornered and the masked man reveals himself as Kabir, a former friend of the duo. However, when he revealed his intentions to conquer the world using this invention, Azad reprimanded him in front of everyone and ordered him to shut down the program since it would go against ethics. Pam suggests destroying them using a high amount of electricity, and the duo kills all the clones by luring them into a power grid, causing them to explode. Amid failed password attempts, Priya awakens and suggests using \u2018Eklavya\u2019, the name of Kabir's own clone. Misha reports to Colonel Azad and explains how the attacker's wounds healed magically. Priya alerted the team about the plan, and Freddy and Rocky were ordered to destroy the program and capture Kabir alive. Freddy and Rocky fight off Kabir's army, and eventually face off against their own clones, who keep rejuvenating due to an internal power source. Azad tells her to keep it a secret and instructs her to enlist court martialed soldiers Firoz (Freddy) and Rakesh (Rocky) for the mission. Freddy, Rocky, Misha and Pam infiltrate Kabir's base where the latter decrypts the password from Priya's brain. Azad also arrives in London, but gets shot by the masked villain. In a flashback, it is revealed that Kabir intended to help the Indian armed forces with the help of his latest invention: a cloning program where clones based on Freddy and Rocky's DNA could be programmed with orders by Azad and win wars without being killed. The team reunites and leaves the base, while Kabir awakens and is revealed to be alive. The perpetrator is a masked man who leaves a message for the Indian Army telling them that he has stolen their weapon and they will have to race against time in order to prevent the destruction of India. However, Kabir reveals that he survived because it was actually his clone Eklavya, whom he loved like a son, that was killed and his death left Kabir traumatised and vengeful. Misha chases after him and gets into a fistfight, impaling him with a sharp weapon. He also reveals the nearly immortal masked men were none other than the duo's clones. Kabir launches the airstrikes before Freddy and Rocky fight him off and kill him by impaling him on a spear. Misha meets the duo and while Rocky agrees to accompany her, Freddy refuses, feeling that his job got him nothing but disrespect in the end.\n\n</PLOT_SUMMARY>"]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.8236663}

Bea rushes upstairs to Cal, who comforts her. Playing one of her grandmother's records inspires Margaret to dance and she remembers Blossom, instilling Bea with hope. That evening, Bea arrives at Margaret's to find her hastily preparing for a return to the hospital because there's been a complication with her father's treatment. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing in Coney Island. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. Some time later, Cal begins reuniting the IFs with their original kids, now grown up. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital. He inspires Bea to use her imagination to redesign the facility, much to the chagrin of Cal. Initially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. After her dad is released from the hospital, he and Bea pack up to go home. When Bea says she does not want to say goodbye to her dad, Cal advises her to tell him a story instead. She tells him a story about realizing she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she's just a child who still needs her father. She rushes back to see Cal, now able to see him again, and wishes him a farewell. She awakens in Cal's apartment where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends, nicknamed IFs, to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them. She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. The landlady shows Bea that the door opens into an old storage room. She, Cal, and Lewis audition the IFs, but he is unable to see any of them. He gives her an idea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. After Bea and her father drive off, Margaret asks Blossom if the two of them should go inside, causing Blossom to realize Margaret can see her. One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. Bea goes upstairs to thank Cal, but no one answers his door. At the hospital, a nurse reassures Bea that her father will be all right. She suddenly realizes that Cal is her own IF, forgotten after the death of her mother. She chafes against his playful antics, insisting she can handle the situation with maturity. Bea finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents and a clown named Calvin.

Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation. The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. The crew is ready on time. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs. They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer. Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew, As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. The NFT by N8 is made by a self-portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue.

Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. After being 'kidnapped', N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US. Cyrus, a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton, pilot Camila, hacker Mi-Sun, safe-cracker Magnus, and engineer Luke. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it."]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.7725654}

The guys had a 'Bible' on Ricky which had notes on every lie they told to their families about stuff they did with Ricky and share the same with Rod to bring him up to speed. Dean is depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud. Dean & JT plan to get Ricky fired to get him out of their lives. Dean asks if she can forgive him. JT and his wife, Susan (Anja Savcic), are about to have a baby shower, and Dean and his girlfriend, Erin (Lex Scott Davis), have been setting it up. Dean feels bad about how Rod was treated and apologizes to him, and this is when Rod gives Dean his business card. Rod has no idea about the merger and begins to record Dean to ask for advice. Rod says that he cannot go back to Atlantic City as he will be killed for some things he did (including being in debt to some mafia types), which he doesn't remember as he was drunk. Erin also drops by, revealing that she scored a reporting gig for a local news channel's 'Hero of the Week' segment, and is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts. Erin meets with Dean and tells him that she knows Ricky Stanicky is Rock-Hard Rod. Erin reveals to Dean that she decided to pursue the story about Rod becoming Ricky. Erin states it will be difficult, but hearing Ricky's recording of Dean talking about his love and appreciation for Erin helps. Erin is heartbroken and says that it is too late for his apologies now. Dean gets a call from 'Ricky' (who is really Wes), claiming that his testicular cancer is back, and that he is alone in Albany, New York. Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. Dean and JT are angry as this is more than what they make.

Initially, they enjoy their time there until a confrontation with Kutty, a senior student, escalates, bruising his ego. Feeling humiliated, Aju seeks revenge and leads his friends to multiple bars in search of gangsters, eventually befriending Ranga, a prominent, eccentric and kind-hearted Malayali-Kannadiga gangster who dresses in all-white. One day after the trio gets drunk, Ranga takes them in their jeep to drop them off at their hostel, but the hostel warden warns them not to arrive late as there are rules in the hostel. Fleeing from Reddy's threats they go back to their house. In retaliation, Kutty and his gang forcefully take the trio to his place and brutally thrash them, only to offer friendship afterward. The trio meets Ranga and tries to express their desire to sever ties with him, revealing that they only befriended him for revenge but hold back when they see Ranga threaten to kill two of his gang members trying to leave the gang. Disillusioned by Ranga's lack of action, they realize his gang merely praises him while engaging in minor violence. They encounter Ranga, now clad in all-black attire as new look, outside the college. So Ranga takes them to his old house, where the trio finds a grim truth in the house. The boys finally decide to confront Ranga and make up a plan to call Reddy when he is alone. Distraught at their betrayal, Ranga faces Reddy's gang alone and emerges victorious, revealing that he kept the boys with him as no one had gotten close to him in his life unless they needed something from him. Realizing their mistake, they apologize to Ranga. Reddy accuses Ranga of stealing his brand and seeks their help to eliminate him. They manage to study there, meanwhile Ranga keeps frantically searching for the boys. After their initial victory against Kutty, their association with Ranga begins to consume their lives, affecting their studies. Unable to handle staying in the house, the trio decides to switch off their phones and leave for a different hostel in Tumkur. Aju, Bibi, and Shanthan are unable to clear their exams by failing in one subject, while Shanthan passes them. They are unable to focus on their studies.

On her father's urging, Elodie agrees to the marriage so her bride price can help their impoverished people. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices. Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm. Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. Elodie escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the Dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters to ensure peace between his people and the dragon. Elodie creates a diversion to reach Floria. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the Dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the Dragon. The Dragon kills them, including Lord Bayford, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the Dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit. With the Dragon at her mercy, she convinces the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent. Elodie then interrupts the wedding of another sacrifice at the palace, exposing the Aurean royal family's treachery. Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note 'Safe Here She Cannot Reach', the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. In Elodie's sleep, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. After learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who the dragon has left alive as bait."]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.7042909}

Noa, a young chimpanzee from a falconry-practicing clan, prepares for a coming-of-age ceremony by collecting eagle eggs with his friends Anaya and Soona. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. Proximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious \u2018book\u2019 capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's 'book', which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. The apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide. In the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away by the rapids. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings.

While they both live alone, the two are friendly with one another -- Clay sees Eloise as the only person who ever took care of him. Eloise sees a warning about two viruses in the system while checking some things on her laptop computer. Verona learns that Eloise was scammed out of every penny she had. The call center's manager, Mickey Garnett, cons Eloise out of everything -- including more than $2,000,000 that's in the account of Safe Homes Foundation, a children's charity whose account she manages. Eloise shoots herself in the head, devastated by the realization that she got scammed out of so much. Upon learning the hard way that Adam is after them, Garnett explains the situation to the crew's ringleader, 28-year-old tech executive Derek Danforth, who runs a Boston-based corporation called Danforth Enterprises. Adam is quickly cleared when Eloise's death is ruled a suicide because there was no gunshot residue on Adam, and Eloise's fingerprints were the only prints on the gun. Verona apologizes to Adam for her accusation, and she tells him that the FBI cyber-crimes office has told her that the scammer crew that victimized Eloise has been operating for two years, but the FBI hasn't been able to identify any of the scammers. Adam finds Eloise's body in her house, and he's immediately arrested by Eloise's daughter, Boston-based FBI Special Agent Verona Parker, who hastily accuses Adam of shooting Eloise. Verona vows to find the scammers, but Adam, enraged by what happened, decides to hunt down the scammers himself, and make them pay for what they did to Eloise. Derek assigns the company's head of security, former CIA director Wallace Westwyld, to find a way to stop Adam. But Wallace learns that Adam is a retired member of a classified program called the Beekeepers, whose members are tasked with fighting different forms of corruption, operating above and beyond governmental jurisdiction. The Beekeepers are so efficient and well-trained that they make the military look like a joke. Adam proves to be an unstoppable force, and Derek, Garnett, and the rest of the scammers have no idea what kind of scorched-Earth hell Adam is about to unleash on them. Wallace realizes that Adam is a man who should be feared by people like Derek.

The photo shows Prince Andrew walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park after photographing a young girl leaving from the same building just prior. In 2010, New York City photographer Jae Donnelly stakes out a private Manhattan home for an exclusive shot. Jae calls to let her know that Epstein is about to be taken into custody by the FBI for child sex trafficking. He eventually photographs Prince Andrew walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park after photographing a young girl leaving from the same building just prior. In the morning, Amanda calls Sam with the interview time. Having spoken to Sam recently, Amanda agrees to meet and negotiate terms for an interview. Called out by a co-worker for being vocally critical of lead presenter Emily Maitlis and for having sensationalist leanings, the programme editor, Esme, has a word with Sam. Her mother gives her a pep talk, reminding her that she was responsible for the story. She knows that she is also a single mother, formally worked in banking and has been working for Andrew for seven years. Working long hours, she does not get to see him often, but she tries to bond with him over a crush he has on a girl and buying him takeout. Including Emily in the dialogue, she tells her she welcomes her innovations, but reminds her they must find a way to work together regardless of the tension. Both Amanda are criticised for meeting Sam for drinks by Jason and Sam by another journalist. So, she tries to contact the photographer. They hold off until Epstein is suddenly found dead in his cell, and rumours circulate about the men's friendship. Sam McAlister left the BBC in 2021 and now teaches negotiation at the London School of Economics. PR representative Jason Stein is consulted, but the prince insists he ended his friendship with Epstein after the mogul's original underage sex scandals had come to light. The televised interview broadcast on 16 November 2019 focuses on Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Epstein and allegations of Andrew's sexual assault of a minor, which Andrew denies on several occasions. After tea, Sam convinces her to leave the grounds for a drink. Prince Andrew's private secretary Amanda Thirsk believes the Epstein photo is a key reason the palace's event was not attended by the press. His lack of remorse and accountability on screen \u2013 along with now-infamous bizarre, erratic statements about visiting a PizzaExpress in Woking and an apparent inability to sweat \u2013 is widely viewed as the public catalyst for the downfall of Prince Andrew, and a major PR crisis for the Royal Family as a whole. Once Newsnight secures the'scoop of the decade', Sam is seemingly left out of the loop, as Esme and Emily work with two male journalists and do not include her. Amid negotiations for the potential interview with Prince Andrew, Amanda asks what Emily is like, then what Sam knows about her. Upset by the altercation, Sam vents to her mother. Jae gets back to Sam, sharing photos of young girls going in and out of Epstein's Manhattan home. After informing Esme, Sam rushes to Amanda's home to convince Prince Andrew to give Newsnight a TV interview. Soon afterwards, the Duke chooses to step down from his royal duties. Despite not admitting guilt, in early 2022, Prince Andrew settled out of court for \u00a312 million for Virginia Giuffre's civil lawsuit for alleged sexual assault. He insists that Epstein has been doing it for many years. The next day, Amanda invites Sam to Buckingham Palace.

She agrees for it and sends her to India, where Aryan introduces her as his girlfriend to his family leading to numerous comical situations. However, when he realizes his love for SIFRA, he decides to sneak out of the engagement ceremony and is caught by his grandfather, who suggests him to follow his heart and assures him that he will handle the family in his absence. He manages to convince his aunt after an emotional conversation, who agrees to let him keep her. Urmila, who was unaware of Aryan's intentions of marrying her, is against him after knowing the truth and orders him to return her as she is her company's IP. Looking at their bonding, the new SIFRA starts to feel jealous and Aryan notices her emotions, shocked of coming to the realization that she can have feelings of her own now. Heartbroken, he returns to India and agrees to an arranged marriage with another woman. Aryan calls his aunt to ask for help, and she sends him a memory backup which Aryan installs, causing her to successfully recover her memory.

Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics displaying the past and future: Skar King once attempted to conquer the surface world, forced Shimo to trigger an ice age, and waged war against Godzilla's species, but Godzilla defeated him by trapping him and his tribe deep within Hollow Earth. Meanwhile, Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, which turns his dorsal plates magenta. On Earth's surface, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and giant monsters, known as \u2018Titans\u2019 \u2014 killing Titan Scylla in Rome and resting in the Colosseum afterwards. The tribe's tyrannical leader, Skar King, battles Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, whom he controls with pain using a crystal. When a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted realm where a tribe of his species has survived, including a juvenile named Suko. Kong returns with Shimo and Suko to Hollow Earth, where he becomes the ape tribe's new leader. After undoing Shimo's ice age with his atomic breath, Godzilla returns to rest in the Colosseum. The prophecy also indicates that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section that houses a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other, living beneath portals to the surface. On the surface, the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother and Kong expert, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Jia reunites with Andrews and alleviates her fears by choosing to stay with her adopted mother. Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. Andrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal. A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra return to the Hollow Earth and engage Skar King and Shimo in battle. They find the Monarch outpost destroyed. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, causing frostbite, but with Suko's help, Kong manages to escape after losing his axe. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Shimo freezes Skar King before Kong shatters him to pieces. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten limb. Inside the temple, Andrews and Jia discover a prophecy that foretells the return of Mothra and the awakening of the Iwi tribe. The prophecy also indicates that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and destroys the crystal controlling Shimo. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat. Unknown to them, one of Skar King's loyalists follows them and informs him that the protective barrier leading to the surface portals has been opened. Mothra restores the protective barrier of the Iwi's home and the portals. Jia successfully awakens the reborn Mothra.\n</PLOT_SUMMARY>"]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.7546446}

She experiences a plane of higher consciousness where all living things are connected and where every possible future can be seen. Cassie is taken to the hospital just as Mary gives birth to her son. Ben revives her, but she begins to experience visions. Initially, she dismisses them as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but after failing to prevent O'Neil's death, Cassie realizes that she can see into the future. Cassie uses her powers to guide the girls to safety. However, her clairvoyance enables her to see fully into the future. Cassie flies to Peru and tracks down the tribal chief who saved her mother. Cassie is also drawn to the same girls and intervenes to stop Ezekiel from ambushing them at Grand Central Terminal. Ezekiel intercepts them again, but Cassie rescues the girls in an ambulance and distracts Ezekiel so Ben and Mary can escape. An ignited firework strikes Cassie in the face, blinding her. Cassie steals a taxi and takes Julia, Anya, and Mattie out of the city to hide them in a nearby forest. Cassie assures the girls that she will mentor them in their future roles when the time comes. After briefly incapacitating Ezekiel by ramming him with the car, Cassie takes the girls back to Queens and they take refuge in Ben's house. The group lures Ezekiel to a condemned firework factory and sets up traps to disorient him while Cassie calls for a medical evacuation helicopter to fly to their location. Ignoring Cassie's instructions, the girls go to a diner where Ezekiel finds them. Cassie is taken to the hospital just as Mary gives birth to her son. In 1973 in the jungles of Peru, a research team led by Ezekiel Sims and his pregnant colleague Constance Webb discovers an unidentified species of spider with rare healing properties. An indigenous tribe attempts to save Constance by having the spider bite her, but she dies shortly after giving birth to Cassandra. Ezekiel betrays the team and claims the spider for himself, shooting Constance in a struggle over the spider before leaving her for dead. Ezekiel, who has limited precognition power and enhanced physical abilities, collects information on three teenage girls: Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon, and Mattie Franklin. Ezekiel destroys the helicopter and separates the girls, then taunts Cassie with Constance's death. His visions lead him to believe that they are destined to kill him. She learns that Constance sought the spider not for fame or money, as she had originally thought, but to save her from having the same fatal hereditary disease that Constance suffered from. The chief puts Cassie through a ritual that separates her soul from her body. She sets off the final trap, which fatally crushes Ezekiel.

A montage of details before the end credits reveal the post operation activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard would receive several commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to take part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels.\n\nMeanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command.\n\nWhile waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength, but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, was captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi-controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission.\n\nWhile SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Richard Heron depart by train, Gubbins enlists Gus March-Phillips to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two tugboats attached to it. On the night of the intended raid, Marjorie and Heron learn that Luhr has had the Duchessa's hull reinforced despite the Italian attache's reservations. Upon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered. Although Luhr eventually catches on when Marjorie's act begins to'slip', the raid is ultimately successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head.\n\nBrigadier Colin Gubbins, with the indirect backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prepares to initiate Operation Postmaster, an off the books black-ops sabotage mission intended to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation on the Spanish-controlled island Fernando Po.

This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother. Janhvi, upon Vanraj's orders, prevents her father from kicking him out. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's phone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches. When police respond to a call from Jyoti's hidden cellphone, the family acts normal to prevent Janhvi from causing an explosion in the house. It is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. He then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj continues to suffer. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children. Realising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. He asks them to give him, as he needs their permission to do so. The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave. Vanraj wakes up and becomes very disappointed at this and as a result he asks her to undress herself and change her clothes. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Jhanvi throw him from the terrace. Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. Kabir offers money in exchange for sparing them but Vanraj sets the money on fire, declaring that he has no use for materialistic things; he reveals himself to be a demon who aims to control the world, believing himself to be as good as God. He then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj continues to suffer. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. When the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. He cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. A year later, Kabir is seen going down into an isolated chamber, where he has, in fact, held Vanraj captive. With Janhvi as the last addition, he prepares to sacrifice them. Earlier, Kabir had taken the home's security camera recording of Vanraj speaking to Janhvi, then spliced his words together to make it seem like Vanraj is ordering the girls to go back to normal. He declares that this is hell now and he is Vanraj's devil. As Kabir and his family recuperate at the hospital, Vanraj's hostages are safely returned to their homes by the police who inform Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing."]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.797044}

In therapy, she defends her reputation as a hopeless romantic until Joe interrupts her for time. They believe that she might be a sex addict, which she quickly denies by criticizing their own romantic choices. She reflects on their story in a dream where she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover. Suddenly, the two suffer a severe crash that leaves Artist's heart ruptured. Now in the present, Artist shares her dream with her therapist. As she leaves in the morning for a therapy session, Mike, a member of her friend group, invites her to his wedding; given his cynical take on love, the invitation bewilders her. She encounters a younger version of herself and apologizes through tears for abandoning their needs, causing her heart to be fully restored (\u2018This Is Me Now\u2019). Before Artist leaves, he recommends that she contacts Love Addicts Anonymous; she is hesitant at first, but eventually joins a group session and shares her story (\u2018Broken Like Me\u2019). With a new lease on life, Artist attends Mike's wedding alone and encounters several hummingbirds that lead her to her true love (\u2018Midnight Trip to Vegas\u2019, \u2018Hummingbird\u2019). While Artist continues with her ill-advised lifestyle, her friends stage an intervention. The Zodiacal Council is alarmed by how quickly Artist is going through her relationships, as well as by the gossip that is emerging as a result. She leaves him for good following a heated argument that grows violent, while the Zodiacal Council, composed of 10 of the 12 astrological signs, questions the origin of her poor romantic decisions. Alida and Taroo, an ancient Puerto Rican legend about two star-crossed lovers from feuding tribes, has greatly influenced Artist's opinions on love and romance. During her session, she tells the therapist about a dream she recently had that follows her through their childhood neighborhood in the Bronx. The therapist moves on to discuss Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra; she is convinced by astrology that they are a good fit, but her friends are concerned for her well-being (\u2018Rebound\u2019). They conclude that in order for her to break her romantic cycle, she must rise above her physical self by embarking on a self-love journey without their assistance.

Kora and Gunnar become lovers, and she admits that Regent Balisarius compelled her involvement in the assassination of the Motherworld's king, queen, and young Princess Issa, with Kora herself shooting the princess. He also reveals that Issa is secretly alive and in hiding, and the assembled group declare their intentions to find her and restore the royal lineage to the throne in order to depose Balisarius. The group also reveal their pasts to each other, but Kora declines to share her involvement in Issa's death. Kora attempts to surrender to him once Noble promises to spare the village, but Gunnar triggers the ambush anyway. Balisarius had then attempted to frame her for the coup, but she had instead fled to Veldt in a Motherworld shuttle to hide from the law. The large contingent of heavily armored and mechanized second wave of Motherworld troops pushes the few remaining defenders back, destroying much of the village, but Kora and Gunnar use the shuttle and stolen uniforms to infiltrate the dreadnought, laying explosives on the engine. The fighters join the small group of villagers to harvest the entire grain supply in three days, so the flour can be used as leverage to prevent the Motherworld forces from simply bombing the village from orbit; over the remaining two days, Titus intends to train the villagers to fight. Over two days, Titus, Nemesis, Tarak, Milius, and Kora train the handful of villagers in combat, preparing a plan involving digging trenches and tunnels in the fields, laying explosives, and preparing Kora's shuttle. When Noble arrives with the dreadnought, his forces scan the village, identifying where the women and children are hiding, protected by Nemesis and Aris, and send forces to capture them to force Kora out. Kora and the surviving warriors return to Veldt, believing that Kora had killed Admiral Noble in hand-to-hand combat and prevented the forthcoming assault on the planet to claim its food supplies, but Aris, a Motherworld soldier working as a double agent for the village people, informs them that the dreadnought ship will arrive in five days. Jimmy arrives to help the village defenders push back the assault, and the explosives bring down the dreadnought. Devra Bloodaxe and her rebel forces arrive in ships to destroy the remaining Motherworld troops, leading to victory. In the process, Gunnar kills Noble but later dies from his injuries. The village people, led by Titus and Tarak, successfully repel the first wave of Motherworld troops, though Nemesis is killed defending the women and children.

Guney (Birkan Sokullu) is Alin's ex-lover, and he has a history with her. Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves. Alin convinces him to take her along. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of his private painting collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment. Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art.

Raiders discover the Green Place while two kids, Furiosa and Valkyrie, are picking peaches. Furiosa attempts to carjack the Rig and return to the Green Place, but Jack easily thwarts her. Having lost her path home, Furiosa shaves her head again, replaces her arm with a mechanical prosthetic, and pursues Dementus by herself as he flees with the remnants of his horde. Furiosa tattoos a star chart to the Green Place on her left arm to find her way home. At peace negotiations, Joe agrees to recognize Dementus's authority over Gastown and increase its supplies of food and water in exchange for the Horde's physician and Furiosa. Immortan Joe decides to attack Gastown, as Dementus's mismanagement has led the facility to near-ruin. Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion. Dementus eventually chases them down and tortures Jack to death. Dementus taunts her, saying revenge will not make her whole. Furiosa attempts to sabotage their motorbikes, but the raiders capture her as a prize for their leader, warlord Dementus of the Biker Horde. After receiving a tip from a stranded soldier, Dementus and the Biker Horde besiege the Citadel, another Wasteland settlement with fresh water and agriculture. They are repelled by the War Boys, the fanatical army of Citadel warlord Immortan Joe. Furiosa becomes Jack's second-in-command and is promoted to Praetorian; the two bond and resolve to escape together one day. For her services, Immortan Joe promotes Furiosa to 'Imperator' and gives her command of a new War Rig. At the Citadel, Immortan Joe imprisons Furiosa in the vault with his stable of 'wives'. One night, Rictus breaks Furiosa out of the vault to make sexual advances toward her; using a wig made from her own hair, she slips from his grasp and disappears. However, Jack recognizes her potential and offers to train her to escape the Citadel if she helps him rebuild his crew. Disguised as a mute teenage boy, Furiosa works her way up the ranks of Immortan Joe's men for over a decade and helps build the 'War Rig', a heavily-armed supply tanker that can withstand raider attacks in the lawless Wasteland. After Joe's son Rictus shows an attraction to her, she devises a plan to escape. In the final scene, the 'Five Wives' hide in Furiosa's War Rig the night before another supply run. Upon arrival, Furiosa helps Joe plan a 40-day war, during which most of Dementus's horde is killed. Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place. Mary stays back to buy Furiosa time to escape and gives her a peach pit to remember her by, but Furiosa returns to her mother anyway. Furiosa's mother Mary pursues them to the Horde's camp, killing all but one raider. After an extended chase, she captures him in the desert. In a voiceover, the potentially unreliable narrator claims that Furiosa imprisoned Dementus at the Citadel and used his living body as fertilizer to grow a peach tree from her mother's seed. He orders Furiosa and Jack to collect weapons and ammunition from the Bullet Farm, an allied mining facility. During one such attack, the Rig's crew are wiped out, leaving its commander, Praetorian Jack, and Furiosa as the only survivors. The last raider delivers Furiosa to Dementus, but Furiosa mortally wounds him before he can reveal the Green Place's location. Dementus changes course, using a Trojan Horse strategy to capture Gastown, an oil refinery that supplies the Citadel with gasoline. However, Dementus, having preemptively attacked and captured the Bullet Farm, ambushes the War Rig on arrival; Furiosa and Jack barely escape, and Furiosa's left arm is severely injured. She eventually meets Joe's five remaining wives in the vault where Joe once held her prisoner. Furiosa escapes her chains by severing her own injured arm, sacrificing her star map to escape; a loner watches Furiosa return to the Citadel. Mary sneaks into the camp and rescues Furiosa; the Horde gives chase.\n\n</PLOT_SUMMARY>"]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.7206323}

Feyd-Rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern Fremen, destroying Sietch Tabr, killing Shishakli, and forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south.

Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her; they agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must succeed her by drinking the Water of Life\u2014a poison fatal for males and untrained women. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him.

Paul remains in the north, fearful that his visions of an apocalyptic holy war will come to pass if he goes south as a messiah. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive, using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar. Shaddam surrenders, but the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, so he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. During another raid on a spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a duel. Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands to marry Irulan. Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sandworm. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul Atreides and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Paul's holy war. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the 'Outer World' will bring prosperity to Arrakis. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan and the Sardaukar. Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm, and raiding Harkonnen spice operations.

Geeta, Jasmine and Divya are flight attendants with Kohinoor Airlines in Mumbai, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. They, however, manage to keep some gold for themselves and distribute it amongst their friends, colleagues, and loved ones. Geeta's husband, Arun, runs a struggling food business from home. She has to financially support her unemployed brother, Punnu, and his wife, Sapna, as well. Geeta funds Arun\u2019s food business, along with helping Punnu and Sapna. Divya is trained to be a pilot but is forced to take up the job of a flight attendant due to a lack of openings and keeps this hidden from her family as well as struggling to repay her education loan. Initially, they had thought that their colleague, Komal, would have tipped the customs officer, however, after an emotional outburst by Komal, they realize that she nor their other colleagues tipped the customs. Someone tips off the customs officials that the three flight attendants are smuggling gold; and even though the three of them hide the stash, the detention that follows makes them feel humiliated and rethink their choice. The enraged customs official, SI Mala, mentions that her tip is accurate which she received from an air hostess within Kohinoor, and cannot come to terms with the fact that she could not recover any gold. Geeta realizes that Mittal's wife, Sudha, was also an air hostess and Mala had referred that the tip came from an ex-air hostess; she was the only person who knew about the gold smuggling. They confront her and she reveals that Mittal is cheating on her and to exact revenge, she tipped the customs so that their arrest would also lead to Mittal's arrest. Mittal also returns to Sudha, along with some of the gold he had stashed for himself. Manoj Mittal, the HR Head of Kohinoor Airlines, is the kingpin of the operation. Jasmine was raised by her maternal grandfather after her parents divorced. Geeta manages to secure a job in the hotel as a housekeeper and get information about the gold. After a lot of hard work, they hatch a plan where they come to know that Walia and his family are taking the gold in a private jet to the Cayman Islands. The staff have not been paid their salaries in months, and the three friends, like all the other employees, keep hoping that things will change. They spike the drinks of the passengers with sleeping pills and land the plane at Divya's native town, Nanheri, where the police and custom officials are already waiting for them. Divya repays her education loan fully. From Sudha, they get the address of Mittal in Al Burj and they tail him and eventually find Walia at a luxury hotel where his daughter is getting married. Vijay Walia, the Chairman of Kohinoor, and Mittal abscond and flee the country as the news comes out. Meanwhile, the other employees of the airline are still trying to make ends meet. Jasmine gets back Nanu\u2019s gold ring from the pawn shop and splurges on herself. However, she further reveals that the real kingpin is actually Walia, who had stolen the airline's money, converted it into gold, and stashed it in Al Burj. The plane in which the three had hidden the stash is exposed one day when turbulence causes damage to the fuselage and the gold falls out.\n</PLOT_SUMMARY>\n\nI hope this is what you were looking for!

Atlas Shepherd, an analyst who shares a mysterious past with this Harlan, is the only person who can find it. To succeed, Atlas must learn to trust Smith, another AI, despite her innate distrust for it. Atlas is introduced to an ARC, an AI which Shepherd does not trust because of her past with Harlan. The ARC is provided with a new CPU containing Smith's, and they travel to Andromeda in the Dhib - a heavily armed ship capable of intergalactic travel which has been equipped with carbon bombs that can destroy anything. It is provided as means of both attack and defense in battle and offers its operator a great deal of protection. The operator rides within the ARC and together they are a fighting team. Back on earth, she is now a 'Ranger' and is provided with a new ARC containing Smith's CPU. They are tasked with capturing the AI, which everyone is sure will return to wipe out humanity. General Jake Boothe, her strongest supporter, is in charge of the military program. Though she's viewed as unstable, General Boothe is convinced by Atlas to let her join the mission to capture or destroy Harlan. Atlas uses Harlan's captured number two Casca to discover its whereabouts. As they approach Harlan's headquarters, his forces wipe out the ARC equipped Rangers leaving only Shepherd and Smith alive. But in the struggle, Smith is destroyed just as a recovery team arrives to save Shepherd. Smith tries to convince Shepherd that she must trust it implicitly so they can synchronize their systems and operate as one - combining her analytical skills with its vast database and warehouse of weapons. It tells her its name is Smith and she must wear a link that will connect her brain with its processor. In the ensuing battle Shepherd relents and gives Smith her complete trust. How does a person capture an AI like Harlan that's always one step ahead?. It is only after this profound decision that the two can sync completely and finally destroy Harlan and his allies. But, it's all been a ploy by Harlan to gain possession of the Dhib and its weapons to return to Earth and annihilate the population."]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.7848217}

When he tests its PKE levels, the orb immediately emits broad-spectrum telekinetic energy. To learn more, he joins Trevor and Lucky to see Nadeem, who reveals that the orb was kept hidden by his grandmother within a brass-lined chamber. Nadeem Razmaadi visits and sells them a strange brass orb with ritual markings inherited from his grandmother. The Ghostbusters begin pursuing escaped ghosts across New York City. A frosty wave travels from the orb to the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters and damages the ecto-containment unit, which is dangerously near capacity. Garraka was confined in the orb due to being vulnerable to copper alloys combined with fire and lacking his devil horns which augment his powers. Winston takes the orb to his privately owned paranormal research center, run by Dr. Upset, Phoebe attempts to control her emotions by playing chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends Melody, the ghost of a teenage girl who died in a fire. Melody reconciles with Phoebe before departing for the afterlife to reunite with her family. Peter Venkman, brought in to help, discovers Nadeem has latent pyrokinetic powers. By controlling Phoebe's disembodied spirit, Garraka forces her physical body to recite the ritual chant. Ray, with help from his fellow veteran Ghostbusters, entraps the god by improvising the ruptured containment unit as a giant trap. In a mid-credits scene, a trucker gets out of his truck to buy something from a vending machine, while the Mini-Pufts steal his vehicle in his absence. Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian. They learn Nadeem's grandmother belonged to the lineage of Firemasters, one of whom prevented Garraka from escaping the orb in 1904 during a mock ritual conducted by members of the Manhattan Adventurers' Society, whom Garraka froze to death. Realizing Garraka will free the ghosts in the containment unit, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters, aided by Nadeem, who dons the Firemaster brass armor kept by his grandmother and attempts to master his powers. Ray suspects it is an apotropaic trap. To appease him, Callie removes underage Phoebe from the team. Phoebe reconfigures her proton pack with copper alloys to strengthen it; Melody, betrayed by Garraka, atones by helping Nadeem utilize his powers to weaken Garraka. She uses his extraction equipment to project herself as a ghost for two minutes so the pair can physically interact. Using an experimental extraction device, Lars is unable to extract any spiritual energy from the orb. After the group captures a ghost in Hell's Kitchen, Walter Peck, the Ghostbusters' long-time opponent, threatens to close them down with his authority as mayor. Garraka overpowers them and breaches the containment unit. After an argument with Gary and her mother, Phoebe runs away and takes Melody to Winston's research center. Meanwhile, Ray and Podcast are collecting cursed objects for examination. Melody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, who has offered her passage to the afterlife. When he discovers the orb's true nature, Lars Pinfield. As the city thaws, the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes, with Peck forced to support the team and reinstate Phoebe. Hubert Wartzki explains the orb was built millennia ago by four sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a phantom god who sought to conquer the world with an undead army who would use \u2018Kusharit Umoti\u2019 - \u2018the power to kill by fear itself. The Ghostbusters are able to defeat Garraka and save the city from his frozen grip. The story concludes with the Ghostbusters reflecting on their victory and the lessons they learned from the experience.\n\n</PLOT_SUMMARY>"]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.744954}

The members of the federation are reluctant, especially Subhankar, but he receives support from President Anjan, who grants him permission. Rahim requests the federation to let him coach the team again and promises that if the team does not win a gold medal, he will not coach any team again in his life. Rahim begins to coach the team again and prepares them for the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta. Rahim decides to spend his remaining days at home with his family and has frequent coughing fits. The Indian team goes on to win the match with a score of 2-1, winning the gold medal at the Asian Games. Rahim agrees to it and decides to take only 16 best players from the team and leave out the rest, including his son Hakim, who had also begun to play for the team. At a party organized for the new team, Rahim and Roy Choudhary have a bitter exchange, where they humiliate each other. The match draws with a score of 1-1 and the Indian team fails to qualify. Rahim personally speaks with the Finance Minister Morarji Desai and requests to let the team participate, explaining its significance. An Indian diplomat publicly criticises the decision of not allowing Israel and Taiwan to play in the competition, which angers the people of Indonesia, leading to massive public protests against the Indian team. The federation removes Rahim as coach for the Indian team on the grounds that the team has failed to give a good performance for a long period of time. Rahim requests for permission to form another team with new players. Rahim then scouts for players from all over India and forms a new team consisting of Tulsidas Balaram from Secunderabad, Peter Thangaraj from Hyderabad and P. However, the Finance Ministry refuses to let the Indian team participate in the competition, given insufficient funds. In their first match, the Indian team is pitted against South Korea and they face defeat, with the teammates blaming one another for their poor performance. Rahim also learns that he has developed lung cancer due to his excessive smoking and will not live long. Thangaraj, the team's goalkeeper is injured before their first match and is replaced by Pradyut Barman, which weakens the team. The members of the All India Football Federation blame the coach Syed Abdul Rahim for the team's underperformance. On the day of the final match, where the Indian team would play against South Korea, the team bus is attacked by protesters and the military is brought in to provide security for them. Neville goes on to score a hat-trick and the Indian team wins the match with a score of 7-1, leaving the Australian team in shock. Roy Choudhary, an influential journalist from Calcutta holds a grudge against Rahim, as he has formed the team with very less number of players from Calcutta. His wife, Saira, motivates him, telling him to not give up and pursue his dream of leading the Indian team to win a gold medal. The Indian team eventually secures the fourth position at the Olympics. Meanwhile, Roy Choudhary and Subhankar plan to remove Rahim from the federation and make Subhankar the President. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami from Calcutta among others. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the Indian team prepares to play against Australia. On seeing Rahim's determination, Roy Choudhary has a change of heart and starts supporting the Indian team. Thangaraj and Singh also rejoin the team for the match. In their next match against Thailand, Jarnail Singh, a player from the Indian team is gravely injured by an opponent. Rahim instructs the Indian team \u2018to make them pay for it\u2019 and they go on to play more aggressively, winning the match with a score of 4-1.

While she tries to get the boat, something in the pool pulls her underwater. Eve manages to retrieve an unconscious Elliot, and is guided to the surface of the pool by Rebecca's spirit. In the present day, the Waller family-Ray, Eve, and children Izzy and Elliot-are seeking a new, permanent residence after Ray has been forced to retire from his baseball career due to illness. They decide to purchase a house with a swimming pool in the backyard, especially after hearing that the pool would be good for Ray's condition. As he spends more time in the pool as part of his therapy, Ray's illness seems to go into remission. During a pool party, their realtor, Kay, tells Eve about the previous owners' daughter Rebecca Summers drowning in the pool shortly before Ray seemingly forces a child underwater and almost drowns himself, although this is attributed to a side-effect of his illness. Eve becomes concerned at the changes she sees in her husband. Eve tries to save her son while Izzy confronts the entity possessing her father, eventually assaulting him with a baseball bat. Once back in the yard, Izzy's assault and Elliot's condition help Ray regain control of himself. When the pool maintenance come to inspect it, they reveal that the pool is essentially self-sustaining, taking its water from an underground spring in the area. Eve is horrified to realize that Ray is now being healed by the pool but it will take one of the children as a sacrifice. Tracking down the Summers family after learning that there is a long history of disappearances in the house, Eve meets with Lucy, Rebecca's mother. Lucy explains that the water that now sustains the pool was once part of a healing spring, but in order to use the water someone else must be sacrificed to it; Lucy was compelled to sacrifice Rebecca to the pool's entity to heal Tommy's illness. To stop the entity attacking his children, Ray sacrifices himself to it. Izzy and Elliot each get attacked by something in the pool, and the family cat goes missing. Eve returns to the house to find that Ray is being directly controlled by the entity, which traps Elliot in the pool and attempts to kill Izzy. Deciding to remain in the house so that no one else falls victim to the entity, Eve, Izzy and Elliot make arrangements for the pool to be filled in to stop such a thing happening again.

Lucy explains that the water that now sustains the pool was once part of a healing spring, but in order to use the water someone else must be sacrificed to it; Lucy was compelled to sacrifice Rebecca to the pool's entity to heal Tommy's illness. To stop the entity attacking his children, Ray sacrifices himself to it. Izzy and Elliot each get attacked by something in the pool, and the family cat goes missing. Eve returns to the house to find that Ray is being directly controlled by the entity, which traps Elliot in the pool and attempts to kill Izzy. Deciding to remain in the house so that no one else falls victim to the entity, Eve, Izzy and Elliot make arrangements for the pool to be filled in to stop such a thing happening again. However, Eve becomes concerned at the changes she sees in her husband. Eve tries to save her son while Izzy confronts the entity possessing her father, eventually assaulting him with a baseball bat. Once back in the yard, Izzy's assault and Elliot's condition help Ray regain control of himself. When the pool maintenance come to inspect it, they reveal that the pool is essentially self-sustaining, taking its water from an underground spring in the area.

A veteran war photographer Lee Smith and journalist colleague Joel meet with their mentor Sammy to share their plan to interview the isolated president. After surviving a suicide bombing in New York City, they arrive at the Charlottesville WF base. Traumatized, the remaining three arrive at the Charlottesville WF base. Lee and Jessie grow closer, trying on clothes at a shop. Despite the president claiming that victory is close at hand, it is considered only a matter of time before the 'Western Forces' (WF), led by Texas and California, reach Washington, D. The trio embeds itself with the WF as they assault Washington, D. C., where Jessie repeatedly exposes herself during fighting to capture photographs, while Lee struggles with combat fatigue. Jessie unemotionally continues into the Oval Office, watching soldiers drag the president from under his desk and prepare to execute him summarily. Continuing, the group spends the night at a refugee camp before passing through a small town where, under watchful guard, residents attempt to live in blissful ignorance. Nearby snipers mock Joel's questioning what side they are on, instead displaying a cynical kill-or-be-killed attitude. Lee recognizes Jessie's potential as a war-photographer and begins to mentor her, while Jessie photographs the militia executing loyalist prisoners. The others are saved by Sammy after he rams the group's truck into members of the militia, but he is mortally wounded during the escape and dies. After the WF breach the White House's fortified perimeter, the presidential limousine attempts to flee but is quickly intercepted and its occupants (which do not include the president) killed. While trying to dissuade them from heading to the capital, Sammy joins them so that he can reach the frontline at Charlottesville, Virginia. The next morning, Lee finds that Joel has allowed a young aspiring photojournalist who Lee encountered at the bombing, Jessie Cullen, to join them. Joel momentarily stops them to get a quote from the president, who replies, 'Don't let them kill me'. Joel drunkenly lashes out at what he views as Sammy's pointless death; Lee tells Jessie that Sammy died while doing what he wanted. After departing the city, the group stops at a gas station that is protected by armed men. One of the guards follows Jessie, but Lee defuses the situation by taking a photo of the man posing with his victims. Jessie steps into the line of fire while taking photos, as Lee sees imminent danger, intercedes and takes a fatal gun shot; Jessie photographs Lee's death as she pushes Jessie to safety. The others catch up to find the pair held at gunpoint by unknown uniformed militia who are burying bodies in a mass grave. C. Later, Jessie berates herself for being too scared to take photos. Following an overnight stop near ongoing fighting, the group documents combat the next day as secessionist militiamen assault a loyalist-held building.

They explore Kodaikanal and before leaving, one of the friends, Sudhi tells them about Guna Caves, a place where the film Gunaa was shot. They decide to visit Guna Caves and reach there inebriated, high and happy, despite a warning from Dominic, a tourist guide. However, they decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves, ignoring the warning.\n\nUpon reaching a point, a few friends decide to etch down their group name \u2018Manjummel Boys\u2019 on the rocks within the cave. They are also accused of murdering Subhash and giving false complaints and no help is offered. Initially everyone assumes Subhash is pulling a prank, but as he does not respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, they take Subhash to the hospital in their hometown, where he is treated more thoroughly.\n\nSubhash suffers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him. They decide not to tell anyone about the incident and tells Subhash's family that he fell in a waterfall.\n\nThe police arrange for more rope and reel Kuttan down further. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Kuttan states that he can hear Subhash's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him.\n\nThe locals also inform them that the specific area was off-limits to people for a reason and that so far 13 people have fallen into that hole and none were ever recovered, dead or alive. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard.\n\nHowever, Kuttan is lowered into the hole, but along the way, the rope with which Kuttan is lowered runs out, and police are worried that it is unsafe to go any lower as there might be low oxygen levels, and they are not willing to risk Kuttan\u2019s life as well. The fire department and more police officers are also called into the scene. Scared even more, the friends reach the local police station, where they are beaten; the police file an FIR against them for entering a restricted area.\n\nAfter the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and others stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. They mention that the British had called Guna Caves as The Devil's Kitchen due to this reason and that the particular hole is over 900 feet deep. They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet.\n\nFinally, after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people for failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to the cave. They decide to go down and try to rescue Subhash. One of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. Subhash, one of the friends, falls into a covered hole in the ground while moving towards them. They are scared to go inside the hole to retrieve him. They try lowering the rope, for Subhash to hold, but are sceptical that he may not be in a situation to hold on to the rope after a deep fall.\n\nKuttan is able to retrieve him and the rest of the friends pull them up together successfully. Later, the news that Kuttan saved Subhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. 2 years later Kuttan is awarded the Jeevan Raksha Padak for his actions.\n</PLOT_SUMMARY>"]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.8030322}
