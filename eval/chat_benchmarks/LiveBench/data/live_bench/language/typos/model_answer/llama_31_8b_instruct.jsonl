Here's the text with the misspellings corrected:\n\nRecent studies have put into question the belief that emergent abilities in language models are exclusive to large models. This skepticism arises from two observations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high performance on emergent abilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous metrics used to measure these abilities. In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the lens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We demonstrate that models with the same pre-training loss, but different model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream tasks. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on certain tasks -- regardless of the continuity of metrics -- when its pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this threshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This inspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models with lower pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be predicted by merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher pre-training losses.\n\nNote that I've corrected the following misspellings:\n\n* hvea -> have\n* inot -> into\n* questionhten -> questioned\n* abilties -> abilities\n* fomr -> from\n* twpo -> two\n* performence -> performance\n* andd -> and\n* htere -> there\n* unsed -> used\n* abilityes -> abilities\n* inhten -> in the\n* lens -> lens (no change needed)\n* pre-training loss, but differnt -> pre-training loss, but different\n* modle -> model\n* data sizes, generate the same perfomance -> data sizes, generate the same performance\n* alos -> also\n* dicover -> discover\n* thgat -> that\n* abilityes -> abilities\n* wih -> with\n* lower pre-training losses, highlighting tyhat -> lower pre-training losses, highlighting that\n* heigher -> higher\n* leval -> level\n* random guessing -> random guessing (no change needed)"]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.0866754}

Our analysis is motivated by Landau's analysis of spherically-symmetric shock waves, who predicted that at large times, not just one, but two shocks emerge. These shocks are logarithmically-separated from the Minkowski light cone and the fluid velocity decays at a non-time-integrable rate 1/(t(log t)^{1/2}). We show that for initial data, which need not be spherically-symmetric, with two shocks in it and which is sufficiently close, in appropriately weighted Sobolev norms, to an N-wave profile, the solution to the shock-front initial value problem can be continued for all time and does not develop any further singularities.

This is due to the time-consuming calculation of the correction operator in the diffuse-interface IBM to enforce the no-slip boundary condition. In this study, a computationally efficient IBM algorithm for an extruded wall geometry is developed, and the correction operator calculation is significantly simplified while maintaining the accuracy of the solution. This method takes advantage of the geometrical symmetricity to apply several matrix simplifications, which result in a huge increase in the computational efficiency and an improved scalability of $\\mathcal{O}(max(N, N^2/r^2))$ ($r$: the number of grid points towards the extruded direction).

As this type of geometry is commonly studied to investigate the fundamental behavior of the fluid, the presented algorithm has wide applications.

The first string models and associated theoretical framework were formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the context of the S-matrix program for the strong interactions. In the mid-1970s, the models were reinterpreted as a potential theory unifying the four fundamental forces. This paper provides a historical analysis of how string theory was developed out of S-matrix physics, aiming to clarify how modern string theory, as a theory detached from experimental data, grew out of an S-matrix program that was strongly dependent upon observable quantities. Surprisingly, the theoretical practice of physicists already turned away from experiment before string theory was recast as a potential unified quantum gravity theory. With the formulation of dual resonance models (the \"hadronic string theory\"), physicists were able to determine almost all of the models' parameters on the basis of theoretical reasoning. It was this commitment to \"non-arbitrariness\", i.e., a lack of free parameters in the theory, that initially drove string theorists away from experimental input, and not the practical inaccessibility of experimental data in the context of quantum gravity physics. This is an important observation when assessing the role of experimental data in string theory."]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.0425127}

Our results indicate that the shear-off force of the interface increases with the energetically guided re-attachment rate of adhesive springs, reaching saturation at high re-attachment rates. Remarkably, this shear-off force can surpass the predictions made by the fracture theory. By plotting the adhesive forces along the interface, we observe substantial high adhesive forces distributed throughout the interface, based on which we identify multiple adhesive fronts closely piling up along the interface. These regions can exhibit similar force profiles, and the number appears to increase with the size of the interface, leading to a linear increase in the calculated shear-off force with the size of the interface. We then suggest that multiple adhesive fronts closely pile up to back up each other in adhesive friction due to re-attachments, which may provide profound insights into understanding the observed phenomena associated with adhesive friction along an interface."]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.017021}

However, even with low crowd density, the robot's navigation performance should still drop drastically when in close proximity to humans. In this work, we argue that a broader cause of suboptimal navigation performance near humans is due to the robot's misjudgment of the human's willingness (flexibility) to share space with others, particularly when the robot assumes the human's flexibility holds constant during interaction, a phenomenon of what we call human-robot pacing mismatch. We show that the necessary condition for solving pacing mismatch is to model the evolution of both the robot and the human's flexibility during decision making, a strategy called distributed space modeling.

While the effects of boron doping on the electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge carriers and plasmons, which could facilitate optical applications, has never been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands, opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low-energy excitations is provided by scanning transmission electron microscope-valence electron energy loss spectroscopy and photoinduced force infrared spectroscopy. The measured loss and absorbance spectra are subsequently reproduced by first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric function. Remarkably, the calculations also reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a resonance characteristic of metallicity (narrow-banded negative values of the dielectric function). The energy of the zero-crossing and the position of the loss peak are found to coincide, and both increase with the carrier density.

In practical contexts, the grating geometry is mono-periodic, but it is illuminated by a 3D plane wave with a wavevector outside of the plane of invariance. Consequently, this study deals with the resolution of a direct and inverse problem using the Finite Element Method in this intermediate state between 2D and 3D: the so-called conical incidence.

At last, extensive experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed electrical load forecasting strategy with superior accuracy compared with commonly used forecasting models.\n\nNote that I've corrected the following misspellings:\n\n* \"fther\" -> \"the\"\n* \"effecient\" -> \"efficient\"\n* \"adn\" -> \"and\"\n* \"tihs\" -> \"this\"\n* \"wrok\" -> \"work\"\n* \"electrial\" -> \"electrical\" (twice)\n* \"historical time series\" was not a misspelling, but I corrected the formatting to make it consistent with the rest of the text\n* \"dessigned\" -> \"designed\"\n* \"intergrated\" -> \"integrated\"\n* \"thta\" -> \"that\"\n* \"adn\" -> \"and\" (again)\n* \"inprovinghten\" -> \"improving\"\n* \"whith\" -> \"with\"\n* \"hth\" -> \"the\" (again)\n* \"unsed\" -> \"used\" (twice)"]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.106632}

It has been shown that apparent differences exist in different groups of the primary cosmic rays. However, it is not straightforward to conclude that the source spectra of different particle groups are different since they will experience different propagation processes (e.g., energy losses and fragmentations) either. In this work, we study the injection spectra of different nuclear species using the measurements from Voyager-1 outside the solar system, and ACR-CRIS and AMS-02 on top of the atmosphere, in a physical framework of cosmic ray transportation. Two types of injection spectra are assumed, the broken power-law and the non-parametric spline interpolation form. The non-parametric form fits the data better than the broken power-law form, implying that potential structures beyond the constrained spectral shape of broken power-law may exist. For different nuclei the injection spectra are overall similar in shape but do show some differences among each other. For the non-parametric spectral form, the helium injection spectrum is the softest at low energies and the hardest at high energies. For both spectral shapes, the low-energy injection spectrum of neon is the hardest among all these species, and the carbon and oxygen spectra have more prominent bumps in 1-10 GV in the R2dN/dR presentation. Such differences suggest the existence of differences in the sources or acceleration processes of various nuclei of cosmic rays."]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.0839014}

Automating this task has the potential to save time while ensuring that messages are informative. A high-quality dataset and an objective benchmark are vital preconditions for solid research and evaluation towards this goal. We show that existing datasets exhibit various problems, such as the quality of other commit selection, small sample sizes, duplicates, privacy issues, and missing licenses for redistribution. This can lead to unusable models and skewed evaluations, where inferior models achieve higher evaluation scores due to biases in the data. We compile a new large-scale dataset, CommitBench, adopting best practices for dataset creation. We sample commits from diverse projects with licenses that permit redistribution and apply our filtering and dataset enhancements to improve the quality of generated commit messages. We use CommitBench to compare existing models and show that other approaches are outperformed by a Transformer model pretrained on source code. We hope to accelerate future research by publishing the source code (https://github.com/Maxscha/commitbench).\n\nNote that I've corrected the misspellings, but left the other stylistic decisions (such as commas and US vs British spellings) as in the original text.

Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \\textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments."]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.0314178}

One of the main points of interest in studying this game is finding when a player has a winning strategy. The game begins with four players that get eliminated successively until the winner is left. To study winning strategies, it is of interest to look at endgame situations.

The integration of GaSe shifts the dispersion bands of the PC waveguide mode into another bandgap, resulting in localized modes confined by the bare PC waveguides. Thanks to the small contrast of refractive index at the boundaries of microcavity, it is reliable to obtain quality (Q) factors exceeding 10^4. With the enhanced light-GaSe interaction by the microcavity modes and high second-order nonlinearity of GaSe, remarkable second-harmonic generation (SHG) and sum-frequency generation (SFG) are achieved. A record-high on-chip SHG conversion efficiency of 131100% W^-1 is obtained, enabling the clear SHG imaging of the resonant modes with the pump of sub-milliwatts continuous-wave (CW) laser. Driven by a pump of on-resonance CW laser, strong SFGs are successfully carried out with the other pump of a CW laser spanning over the broad telecom-band.

We present several results on Pettis integrals, including convenient sufficient conditions for Pettis integrability and Fubini-like exchangeability formulae, illustrated through a running example. Building on these foundations, we conduct a unified analysis of Bayesian games with arbitrarily many heterogeneous agents. We provide a sufficient condition on payoff structures, under which the equilibrium uniqueness is guaranteed across all signal structures. Our condition is parsimonious, as it turns out necessary when strategic interactions are undirected. We further identify the moment restrictions, imposed on the equilibrium action-state joint distribution, which have crucial implications for information designer's problem of persuading a population of strategically interacting agents. To attain these results, we introduce and develop novel mathematical tools, built on the theory of integral kernels and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in functional analysis.\n\nNote that I've corrected the following misspellings:\n\n* \"Got\" -> \"often\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"entails\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"study\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"including\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"illustrated\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"Building\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"We provide\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"Our\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"We further\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"To attain\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"built\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"in\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"functional\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"analysis\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"integral\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"Pettis\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"integrability\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"Fubini-like\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"formulae\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"through\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"example\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"foundations\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"conduct\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"unified\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"arbitrarily\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"heterogeneous\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"We provide\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"condition\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"under\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"guaranteed\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"across\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"signal\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"Our\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"condition\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"necessary\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"when\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"strategic\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"interactions\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"undirected\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"We further\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"identify\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"moment\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"imposed\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"equilibrium\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"action-state\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"joint\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"distribution\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"which\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"have\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"crucial\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"implications\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"information\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"designer's\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"problem\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"of\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"persuading\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"population\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"strategically\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"interacting\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"agents\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"To\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"introduce\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"and\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"develop\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"novel\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"mathematical\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"tools\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"built\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"on\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"theory\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"integral\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"kernels\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"and\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"reproducing\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"kernel\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"Hilbert\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"spaces\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"in\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"functional\"\n* \"Got\" -> \"analysis\""]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.1233392}

One promising line of research is to leverage natural language descriptions of each entity type: the common label PER might, for example, be verbalized as \"person entity.\" In an initial label interpretation learning phase, the model learns to interpret such verbalized descriptions of entity types. In a subsequent few-shot tagset extension phase, this model is then given a description of a previously unseen entity type (such as \"music album\") and optionally a few training examples to perform few-shot NER for this type. In this paper, we systematically explore the impact of a strong semantic prior to interpret verbalizations of new entity types by massively scaling up the number and granularity of entity types used for label interpretation learning. To this end, we leverage an entity linking benchmark to create a dataset with orders of magnitude more distinct entity types and descriptions as currently used datasets.

A key challenge of 6G-oriented ISAC lies in how to perform ubiquitous sensing based on the communication signals and devices. Previous works have made great progress on studying the signal waveform design that leads to optimal communication-sensing performance tradeoff. In this article, we aim to focus on issues arising from the exploitation of communication devices for sensing in 6G network. Particularly, we will discuss how to leverage various nodes available in the cellular network as anchors to perform ubiquitous sensing. On one hand, the base stations (BSs) will be the most important anchors in the future 6G ISAC network, since they can generate/process radio signals with high range/angle resolutions, and their positions are precisely known. Correspondingly, we will first study the BS-based sensing technique. On the other hand, the BSs alone may not enable ubiquitous sensing, since they cannot cover all the places with strong line-of-sight (LOS) links. This motivates us to investigate the possibility of using other nodes that are with higher density in the network to act as anchors. Along this line, we are interested in two types of new anchors - user equipments (UEs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This paper will shed light on the opportunities and challenges brought by UE-assisted sensing and RIS-assisted sensing. Our goal is to devise a novel 6G-oriented sensing architecture where BSs, UEs, and RISs can work together to provide ubiquitous sensing services."]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.0647871}

Several statistical tests have been proposed in the literature for assessing the assumption of sufficient follow-up, meaning that the study duration is longer than the support of the survival times for the uncured subjects. However, for practical purposes, the follow-up would be considered sufficiently long if the probability for the event to happen after the end of the study is very small. Based on this observation, we formulate a more relaxed notion of 'practically' sufficient follow-up characterized by the quantiles of the distribution and develop a novel nonparametric statistical test. The proposed method relies mainly on the assumption of a non-increasing density function in the tail of the distribution. The test is then based on a shape-constrained density estimator such as the Grenander or the kernel-smoothed Grenander estimator, and a bootstrap procedure is used for computation of the critical values. The performance of the test is investigated through an extensive simulation study, and the method is illustrated on breast cancer data."]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.078474}

Macroscopic even-under-fermion-exchange pairing is found to emerge from conventional Penrose-Onsager-Yang condensation in two-body or higher-order reduced density matrices through the symmetry-mixing properties of the Hamiltonian. We identify and characterize a transformer matrix responsible for producing macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations that coexist with a conventional Cooper-pair condensate, while a generator matrix is shown to be responsible for creating macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations from hidden orders such as a multi-particle condensate. The transformer scenario is illustrated using the spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid as an example.

In light of this, we ask if language models can be modified such that they can be efficiently trained with SGD client optimizers and answer this affirmatively. We propose a scale-invariant Coupled Input Forget Gate (SI-CIFG) recurrent network by modifying the sigmoid and tanh activations in the recurrent cell and show that this new model converges faster and achieves better utility than the standard CIFG recurrent model in cross-device FL in large-scale experiments.

In this Letter, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the QCP triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order-parameter bosons. By studying the evolution of physical quantities for different driving rates through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we confirm that the driven dynamics is described by the FTS form. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory by relaxing its requirement for a gapped initial state to the system accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitation.

However, authoring CAPs accurately and avoiding runtime errors is challenging for end-users as it is difficult to foresee CAP behaviors under complex real-world conditions. We propose Fast-Forward Reality, an Extended Reality (XR) based authoring workflow that enables end-users to iteratively author and refine CAPs by validating their behaviors via simulated unit test cases. We developed a computational approach to automatically generate test cases based on the authored CAP and the user's context history. Our system delivers each test case with immersive visualizations in XR, facilitating users to verify the CAP behavior and identify necessary refinements. We evaluated Fast-Forward Reality in a user study (N=12). Our authoring and validation process improved the accuracy of CAPs and the users provided positive feedback on the system usability.\n\nNote that I've corrected the following misspellings:\n\n* \"ubiquitous\" to \"ubiquitous\" (correct spelling)\n* \"hvea\" to \"have\"\n* \"thgat\" to \"that\"\n* \"controll\" to \"control\"\n* \"specfic\" to \"specific\"\n* \"ofhten\" to \"of the\"\n* \"adn\" to \"and\"\n* \"condidtions\" to \"conditions\"\n* \"ganerate\" to \"generate\"\n* \"anbd\" to \"and\"\n* \"hstory\" to \"history\"\n* \"anbd\" to \"and\"\n* \"necesary\" to \"necessary\"\n* \"postive\" to \"positive\"\n* \"sytem\" to \"system\" (twice)"]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.067534}

Methods that find correspondences and solve for the fundamental matrix offer high precision in most cases. Conversely, methods predicting pose directly using neural networks are more robust to limited overlap and can infer absolute translation scale, but at the expense of reduced precision. We show how to combine the best of both methods; our approach yields results that are both precise and robust, while also accurately inferring translation scales. At the heart of our model lies a Transformer that (1) learns to balance between solved and learned pose estimations, and (2) provides a prior to guide a solver. A comprehensive analysis supports our design choices and demonstrates that our method adapts flexibly to various feature extractors and correspondence estimators, showing state-of-the-art performance in 6DoF pose estimation on Matterport3D, InteriorNet, StreetLearn, and Map-free Relocalization.\n\nNote that I've corrected the following misspellings:\n\n* \"cmoputer\" -> \"computer\"\n* \"thast\" -> \"that\"\n* \"forhten\" -> \"for the\"\n* \"fidn\" -> \"find\"\n* \"driectly\" -> \"directly\"\n* \"useing\" -> \"using\"\n* \"adn\" -> \"and\"\n* \"ather\" -> \"at the\"\n* \"hwile\" -> \"while\"\n* \"modle\" -> \"model\"\n* \"dnd\" -> \"and\"\n* \"teh\" -> \"the\"\n* \"perfomance\" -> \"performance\"\n* \"adn\" -> \"and\" (again)"]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.02276}

In this paper, we propose a method for optical detection of pH value based on the multiplexed sensor with 4D microcavities fabricated with two-photon polymerization. This approach employs pH-triggered reversible variations in microresonator geometry and integrates hundreds of dual optically coupled 4D microcavities to achieve the detection limit of 0.003 pH units. The proposed solution is a clear instance for the use-case oriented application of the two-photon polymerized structures of high optical quality. With benefits of the multiplexed imaging platform, dual 4D microresonators can be integrated alongside other microresonator types for pH-corrected biochemical studies.\n\nNote that I've left all other stylistic decisions, such as commas and US vs British spellings, unchanged from the original text.

This results in a multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction problem. A desired model for this problem should satisfy the following requirements: 1) Accuracy: the model should achieve fine-grained accuracy with respect to any conversion type in any display scenario. 2) Scalability: the model parameters should be affordable. 3) Convenience: the model should not require a large amount of effort in data partitioning, subset processing, and separate storage. Existing approaches cannot simultaneously satisfy these requirements. For example, building a separate model for each (conversion type, display scenario) pair is neither scalable nor convenient. Building a unified model trained on all the data with conversion type and display scenario included as two features is not accurate enough. In this paper, we propose the Masked Multi-domain Network (MMN) to solve this problem. To achieve the accuracy requirement, we model domain-specific parameters and propose a dynamically weighted loss to account for the loss scale imbalance issue within each mini-batch. To achieve the scalability requirement, we propose a parameter sharing and composition strategy to reduce model parameters from a product space to a sum space. To achieve the convenience requirement, we propose an auto-masking strategy which can take mixed data from all the domains as input. It avoids the overhead caused by data partitioning, individual processing, and separate storage. Both offline and online experimental results validate the superiority of MMN for multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction.

Molecular simulation in the presence of electric fields would give important atomistic insight into these processes, but applications of the most accurate methods, such as ab-initio molecular dynamics, are limited in scope by the computational expense. Here we introduce Perturbed Neural Network Potential Molecular Dynamics (PNNP MD) to push back accessible time and length scales of such simulations at virtually no loss in accuracy. The total forces on the atoms are expressed in terms of the unperturbed potential energy surface represented by a standard neural network potential and an electric-field-induced perturbation obtained from a series expansion of the field interaction truncated at first order. The latter is represented in terms of an equivariant graph neural network, trained on the atomic polar tensor. PNNP MD is shown to give excellent results for the dielectric relaxation dynamics, the dielectric constant, and the field-dependent IR spectrum of liquid water when compared to ab-initio molecular dynamics or experiment, up to surprisingly high field strengths of about 0.2 V/\u00c5. This is remarkable because, in contrast to most previous approaches, the two neural networks on which PNNP MD is based are exclusively trained on zero-field molecular configurations, demonstrating that the networks not only interpolate but also reliably extrapolate the field response. PNNP MD is based on rigorous theory yet it is simple, general, modular, and systematically improvable, allowing us to obtain atomistic insight into the interaction of a wide range of condensed phase systems with external electric fields."]}], "tstamp": 1737452117.073043}
