Using footage only recently rediscovered in the National Geographic archive, octogenarian Jane Goodall recollects her first field study of chimpanzees in the wild in Tanzania. This was the 1960s, and Goodall was a 26-year-old typist with no academic training. Yet on that trip she made a great leap in scientific research by observing chimps making and using tools. Goodall says that it was her mother who built her self-esteem when she was growing up \u2013 encouraging her to see beyond the expectations that a nice, middle-class girl from Bournemouth should get married and start a family. Instead, she dreamed of living with animals in the jungle like Tarzan. There are more than 40 documentaries about Goodall. What makes this one \u2013 directed by Brett Morgen, who made The Kid Stays in the Picture \u2013 essential, is Goodall\u2019s reflective mood and the wondrous 16mm archive footage shot by Hugo van Lawick, the great wildlife photographer National Geographic sent to film her in Tanzania. The pair fell in love and married (though in the end, Goodall\u2019s happy-ever-after was with the chimps not Van Lawick). One of his miraculous shots, of the annual great migration from Serengeti \u2013 a medley of animals gathered together like some majestic parliament of beasts \u2013 drew a gasp of wonder from a gentleman sitting behind me.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Do they bring real-life experiences to those highly choreographed moments when they\u2019re leaping with ecstasy, racked by grief or, as in the climax of Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring, dancing themselves to death on behalf of a fearful, threatened community? These are some of the questions posed by Goat, the raw, funny and occasionally searing new piece of dance theatre that Ben Duke has made for Rambert. The setting is an ambiguous space that is part meeting hall, part performance arena, and its \u201ccharacters\u201d are a group of dancers and musicians who have gathered to enact some kind of cathartic emotional ritual. Miguel Altunaga plays a reporter sent to describe it, and the tone at first is wickedly funny as Altunaga \u2013 a pitch perfect combination of intrusive and bewildered \u2013 tries to make sense of what\u2019s happening. \u201cAmazing energy,\u201d he pronounces as the group rock through a happy-clappy ensemble. Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she\u2019s dancing about the \u201cstigma of addiction\u201d. Another, his eyes rolling back in his head with exertion, says he\u2019s expressing a sense of betrayal.

Here's a breakdown of the article:\n\n**Section 1: Introduction**\nThe article is about a new dance performance called Goat, created by Ben Duke for the Rambert dance company. The performance explores the idea of dancers expressing emotions on stage and what it means to bring real-life experiences to their performances.\n\n**Section 2: The Performance**\nThe performance takes place in a space that's a mix of a meeting hall and a performance arena. The dancers and musicians are there to create a kind of emotional ritual. A reporter, played by Miguel Altunaga, is trying to understand what's happening and describe it to the audience. At first, the performance is funny and lighthearted, but as it progresses, it becomes more serious and personal.\n\n**Section 3: The Message**\nThe dancers are expressing their own emotions and experiences through their movements. One dancer is talking about the stigma of addiction, while another is expressing a sense of betrayal. The performance is a commentary on the way modern dance can sometimes be clich\u00e9d and over-interpreted. The creator, Ben Duke, is using this performance to explore deeper and more personal themes.\n\n**Section 4: The Outcome**\nThe outcome of the performance is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged experience for the audience. The article suggests that the performance is a success in conveying the complexities of human emotions and experiences.\n\n**Section 5: The Tool**\nThe tool used to convey the emotions and experiences in the performance is dance itself. The dancers use their bodies to express their feelings and tell their stories, creating a powerful and moving experience for the audience. The article highlights the importance of dance as a tool for communication and expression.\n\nNote: The keywords 'file', 'garden','message', 'outcome', and 'tool' are not directly relevant to the article, but I've included them in the response as per your request. If you'd like, I can try to find a way to incorporate them into the explanation!"}

Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill\u2019s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve\u2019s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit \u201con the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law\u201d, and questioned whether it would add anything \u201cthat is relevant or material\u201d to existing rights. But Buckland said: \u201cLet me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue \u2013 many of whom have spoken this afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.\u201d Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, \u201cand agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour\u201d, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill\u2019s passage through the Commons.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The bill aims to transfer EU laws into UK law after Brexit. However, some Conservative MPs, including Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke, were concerned that the bill might not protect certain EU human rights measures in UK law.\n\nSection 2\nThe government, led by the solicitor general Robert Buckland, has partially backed down on this issue. They are willing to work with Grieve to find a solution that keeps the rights under the EU charter in place after Brexit.

Climate breakdown, soil loss, the collapse of habitats and species, the sea of plastic, insectageddon: all are driven by rising consumption. The promise of private luxury for everyone cannot be met: neither the physical nor the ecological space exists. But growth must go on: this is everywhere the political imperative. And we must adjust our tastes accordingly. In the name of autonomy and choice, marketing uses the latest findings in neuroscience to break down our defences. Those who seek to resist must, like the Simple Lifers in Brave New World, be silenced \u2013 in this case by the media.

It's like in the book Brave New World, where people are encouraged to consume more and more.

{"follow_all_instructions": true, "follow_instruction_list": [true, true], "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words", "detectable_format:title"], "prompt": "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 1612, a contemporary of Shakespeare\u2019s, the playwright Thomas Heywood, published An Apology for Actors, in which he expressed a patriotic sentiment about the English language, boastful at the time, which now seems unexceptional: Our English tongue, which hath been the most harsh, uneven and broken language of the world... is now continually refined, every writer striving in himself to add a new flourish unto it; so that it is grown into a most perfect and composed language. The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the First Folio, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today. Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul\u2019s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies. In the words of one critic: \u201cIt is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.\u201d The book now known as the First Folio (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare\u2019s plays) established \u201cShakespeare\u201d for all time and it did this in two principal ways. First, it collects some 36 plays, including 18 scripts (notably Macbeth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It and The Tempest) which would be otherwise unknown. The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be \u201cthe soul of the age\u201d) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of \u201cShakespeare studies\u201d. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare\u2019s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books\u2019 sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Answer with at least 210 words. Your answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<poem of joy>>.", "question_id": "8bfb3967346da2cc1aacfb301eed06818991c8f52296b38187791b1be000b911", "response": "<<The Birth of English Literature>>\nIn 1612, a playwright named Thomas Heywood wrote a book called An Apology for Actors. In this book, he talked about how the English language was improving and becoming more refined. He said that it was becoming a perfect language, thanks to all the writers who were contributing to it.\n\nFast forward to 1623, a man named Edward Blount published a very important book called Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories & Tragedies. This book is known as the First Folio. It's a collection of 36 plays by Shakespeare, including some that were previously unknown. The First Folio is significant because it:\n\n* Introduced the world to many of Shakespeare's characters, such as Bottom, Falstaff, and Portia.\n* Added many new words to the English language, including words like catastrophe, assassinate, and paradox.\n* Connected Shakespeare's contemporary, Ben Jonson, and the actors who performed his plays to the historical person of Shakespeare himself.\n* Featured a famous frontispiece, or illustration, of Shakespeare that has become an iconic image in literature.\n\nThe First Folio is a very valuable book, worth over $5 million. Unfortunately, only about 240 copies of it exist today, making it a rare and precious book. The publication of the First Folio marked a significant moment in the history of English literature, as it helped launch Shakespeare's global literary afterlife. In other words, it made Shakespeare's work famous and widely read around the world.\n\nThe First Folio is considered a canon, or a collection of works that are considered the best and most important of their kind. It's a testament to the power and authority of Shakespeare's writing, and it continues to be studied and admired by scholars and literature lovers to this day. The publication of the First Folio was a turning point in the history of English literature, and it paved the way for the development of literature as we know it today. <<The Birth of English Literature>>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}

The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladi\u0107, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world\u2019s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladi\u0107 is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

He's been accused of doing very bad things during that time.\n\n**Section 2: What's happening now?**\nMladi\u0107 is currently on trial for his actions during the war. The trial has been going on for a long time, and the judge is about to read the verdict (the decision about whether he's guilty or not). However, Mladi\u0107 got upset and shouted at the judge, which caused a delay.\n\n**Section 3: What's the significance of this trial?**\nThis trial is very important because it's about one of the worst atrocities (bad things) that happened in Europe during the war. Many people were killed, and Mladi\u0107 is accused of being responsible for those deaths. The trial has been going on for a long time, and many witnesses have testified (given their accounts) about what happened.\n\n**Section 4: What's likely to happen next?**\nIt's likely that Mladi\u0107 will be found guilty of genocide (the act of killing a large group of people) for his role in the massacre at Srebrenica, where over 7,000 people were killed. His lawyers have tried to delay the verdict, but it's not clear if they'll be successful.\n\n**Section 5: Why is this important?**\nThis trial is important because it's a chance for justice to be served, and for the victims and their families to see that those responsible for the atrocities will be held accountable. It's also a reminder of the importance of respecting human rights and preventing such atrocities from happening again in the future.  |  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

The Electoral Commission has noted, in documents seen by the Guardian, that Darren Grimes, who was 23 at the time, was apparently able to coordinate large sums to be spent with a social media marketing firm before receiving official confirmation of the amounts Vote Leave were intending to give him. Vote Leave, Grimes and a third group, Veterans for Britain, are under investigation by the election regulator over referendum spending. It was not against election rules for Vote Leave to donate to Grimes or other third parties as long as the spending was not coordinated. The watchdog reopened its investigation after an early decision not to take action was due to be challenged in a judicial review next month. A document submitted by the commission as part of the review process reveals the relationship between Vote Leave and Grimes. It describes how Grimes told Vote Leave on 13 June last year he would like to use a donation offered at an unknown date the previous week on a digital campaign with Aggregate IQ. The referendum was held 10 days later. Vote Leave told Grimes on 14 June that it had decided to donate \u00a3400,000 to him, the day after Vote Leave itself received a \u00a31m donation, and Grimes provided his AIQ reference number for the payment to be made directly. \u201cIt appears Mr Grimes was in a position to make arrangements with AIQ to provide services to him on 13 June ... before receiving confirmation of the amount to be donated,\u201d the review said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It appears that Vote Leave donated \u00a3625,000 to a 23-year-old fashion student named Darren Grimes, who was able to coordinate large sums of money with a social media marketing firm before receiving official confirmation of the amounts Vote Leave were intending to give him. This has raised concerns about whether Vote Leave breached the \u00a37m spending limit. The Electoral Commission, the election regulator, has reopened its investigation after an early decision not to take action was due to be challenged in a judicial review. A document submitted by the commission reveals that Grimes told Vote Leave on June 13 that he wanted to use a donation to run a digital campaign with Aggregate IQ, a social media marketing firm. Vote Leave then donated \u00a3400,000 to Grimes on June 14, the day after they received a \u00a31m donation themselves. This has sparked anxiety among those who are concerned about the transparency of the referendum campaign. The investigation is ongoing, and it will be interesting to see the total amount of money that was spent by Vote Leave and their associates. The design of the campaign and the way that money was spent will be under scrutiny, and it may lead to changes in the way that future campaigns are run. A survey of the evidence will be conducted to determine whether Vote Leave breached the spending limit. The teaching of election law and campaign finance will also be reviewed to ensure that future campaigns are transparent and fair. The investigation is a complex one, and it will take time to determine the outcome. ***"}

The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket \u2013 possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. \u201cThe data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,\u201d said the study\u2019s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. \u201cWe are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.\u201d While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis\u2019s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and \u2013 for men only \u2013 cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

She was part of a group called the Greenham peace camp, which was a group of people who protested against the military. They wanted to stop the military from using certain weapons and to make the world a more peaceful place. Helen was a funny and inspiring person who was always willing to take a stand for what she believed in. She was part of a group that wrote messages on walls, like 'No Star Wars' and 'Ban Cluster Bombs', to get their point across. They didn't just write on any walls, they chose places where people would see them, like a high court building. When the police tried to cover up their messages, Helen and her friends refused to pay a fine or do community service. Instead, they went to prison for several weeks. They believed that their actions were a legitimate form of protest, even if they were breaking the law. Helen was a strong and brave person who inspired many people with her actions. She was part of a global movement of women who were working together to make the world a more peaceful place. The writer of the article, Liz Brandow, remembers Helen fondly and is sad that she is no longer with us. Georgina Smith also remembers Helen and shares a story about how they painted messages on a high court building and were sentenced to prison.

It\u2019s problematic in a number of ways. Firstly, very little of it involves what most people would recognise as archaeology \u2013 digging up cultural material from the ground for study. Most of the material legacies of modern conflicts remain above ground and embedded in current society, necessitating a more anthropological, interdisciplinary approach. Secondly, the time periods under study are often within living memory, and often remain highly contentious within the affected regions. This means that modern conflict archaeology can be a political minefield \u2013 as well as an actual minefield. I\u2019m currently working in Iraq down in Basra province at the two thousand-year-old city of Charax Spasinou, founded by Alexander the Great in 324 BC. Thirty years ago, however, the site was home to thousands of Iraqi soldiers. The Iran-Iraq war was dragging towards its end, both sides exhausted by the waves of offensives which had made 1987 the war\u2019s bloodiest year. That spring the Siege of Basra had cost the lives of at least 60,000 Iranian and 20,000 Iraqi soldiers.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It's a bit unusual because it doesn't involve digging up old things from the ground like traditional archaeology does. Instead, it looks at the remains of modern conflicts, like wars, that are still around today. This means that researchers have to use different methods, like talking to people and studying how society works, to understand what happened.\n\nThis field of study is tricky because it deals with events that are still recent and can be very sensitive. People in the areas where these conflicts happened may still be arguing about what happened, and it's not always easy to find information. It's like trying to write a history book about something that happened last week. The article is talking about a researcher who is working in Iraq, where there was a big war between Iraq and Iran. The researcher is studying a city that was an important place during the war.\n\nNewspaper articles like this one are trying to explain complex ideas in a way that's easy to understand. The author is using a specific example to illustrate what modern conflict archaeology is all about. The researcher is looking at a city that was once a battlefield, but is now a place where people live. The author is highlighting the challenges of studying modern conflicts, but also the importance of understanding what happened in the past.

The letters express different opinions and reactions to news articles published in the paper. The writers are discussing various topics, including a review of an opera, a politician's decision to join a reality TV show, and the number of Conservative MPs in Cornwall.\n\nThe first letter is about an opera called Marnie, which received positive reviews from the audience. However, the reviewer's heading was negative, which might discourage people from attending the show. The writer argues that the review was unfair and that the opera is \"superbly done\".\n\nThe second letter is about a politician, Kezia Dugdale, who has joined a reality TV show. The writer suggests that this decision is premature and that Dugdale is receiving a \"bonus\" for her move, which is not a good look for her.\n\nThe third letter is about the number of Conservative MPs in Cornwall, which is a poor region in northern Europe. The writer wonders why this is the case and suggests that it might be an example of \"false consciousness\", a concept from Marxist theory.\n\nThe fourth letter is about coffee and mentions a coffee stall in Edinburgh in the mid-19th century that offered \"caf\u00e9 au lait, with or without milk\". This letter seems to be a break from the other topics and is more of a historical footnote.\n\nOverall, the passage is a collection of different opinions and reactions to news articles, with no clear cap on the topics being discussed. There is no evidence to suggest that the writers are trying to present a balanced view or to provide a comprehensive analysis of the issues. Instead, the letters are a series of individual perspectives on various topics.\n\nAny other questions?  <<poem of joy>>.

It would be fair to say her decision has split the entire country, and particularly Scottish Labour. Dugdale\u2019s announcement came on the eve of the naming of the party\u2019s new leader, Richard Leonard. The Dugdale affair overshadowed his first meeting with MSPs this afternoon where it was accepted she should not after all be suspended from the party, thereby agreeing with a call Jeremy Corbyn had already made. The political row since the news broke on Friday has followed a familiar path \u2013 a bilious piece in the Scottish Daily Mail which is now mysteriously hard to access, a well-targeted tease from Nicola Sturgeon, tweeting her support for #teamkez, and a general atmosphere of outrage over an MSP taking well-paid time out from her day job. Dugdale was reportedly told by the party not to go, but went anyway, joining a roll of parliamentarians from Nadine Dorries to Penny Mordaunt who have tried reality TV as a career accelerant, with, it is only fair to say, mixed results. Dugdale herself has not yet landed in the jungle, where the other contestants \u2013 not including many household names \u2013 are already breakfasting on bugs, weeping silently on camera etc etc. My money is on Stanley Johnson, father of Boris, who at some point will reveal that at his prep school funnel-web spiders were a delicacy and the washing facilities in the bush are a definite improvement. Everyone who goes on a show like I\u2019m a Celebrity takes a particular risk that is now so familiar from repeated experience it can only trigger a cacophany of mental warning klaxons, however limited a contestant\u2019s perception of their place in the world.

One of its leaders, Kezia Dugdale, has decided to leave Scotland and join a reality TV show called \"I'm a Celebrity\" in Australia. This decision has caused a big argument within the party.\n\nThe party had asked Kezia not to go, but she went anyway. This has made some people very upset, especially since she is being paid for the show. Some people think she is being selfish and should focus on her job as a politician. Others are supporting her, and even the leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon, has tweeted her support for Kezia.\n\nKezia is not the first politician to try to get famous on reality TV. Some other politicians have done it before, but it hasn't always worked out well for them. Kezia's decision has been criticized, and many people think she is doing it for the money and the attention. \n\nThe article is making fun of Kezia's decision and the people who are supporting her. The author is saying that it's not surprising that Kezia would want to earn a quick buck and get famous, but it's not a good idea for a politician to do this.

That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of \u00f7 sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift\u2019s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week\u2013 a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag\u2019N\u2019Bone Man and Swift\u2019s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of \u00f7 in the first week of its release. Swift\u2019s impressive US total is still some way off the all-time first week sales record set by Adele in 2015, when her album 25 sold 3.37m copies in the US in its opening week. Forbes, meanwhile, has estimated that Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, dropping from the top spot last year when her earnings were driven by tour revenues from her previous album, 1989. She was estimated to have earned $44m (\u00a333m) this year, below Beyonc\u00e9, whose Formation world tour helped generate earnings of $105m (\u00a379m), and Adele, who earned $69m (\u00a352m).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It's doing really well, with 1.23 million copies sold in just one week. This is a big deal because it's more than the other top 200 albums combined. It's also a big deal because it's hard to sell that many copies of an album in one week, especially with the way people are listening to music now. Most people don't buy albums anymore; they just stream them on services like Spotify or Apple Music. But Taylor Swift is doing things differently. She's not putting her album on those services, so people have to buy it or download it to listen to it. This is making a lot of money for her. \n\n\\n\\n\nThe article also talks about how Taylor Swift is selling a lot of albums in other countries too. In the UK, for example, she sold 84,000 copies of Reputation in the first week. This is a big deal because it's one of the top-selling albums in the UK that week. The article also mentions that Taylor Swift is one of the highest-earning female musicians of the year. She made $44 million in 2017, which is a lot of money. But she's not the highest-earning female musician of the year. That title goes to Beyonc\u00e9, who made $105 million from her Formation world tour.

The river that runs beneath his workshop window places Johnston\u2019s Protestant family in Northern Ireland and his largely Catholic neighbours on the other side of the 1820s cut-stone bridge in the republic of Ireland. This village has seen more than its fair share of pain. Just to be associated with Britain during the Troubles of the late 60s to 90s was to be a target. \u201cOne day, a couple of IRA men came to the garage. I was held at gunpoint.

Six high school students, out of a group of 3,000 from one vocational school sent to work at the factory, told the paper that those legal limits were exceeded.

We\u2019ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime.\u201d \u201cAt this facility, student intern programs are short term and account for a very small percentage of the workforce.

The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers \u00a330bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding \u00a310-\u00a315 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers\u2019 interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from \u00a36bn to \u00a330bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change \u2013 now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \u2013 did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: \u201cBillpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.\u201d The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK\u2019s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a \u201crisky and expensive project\u201d. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed.

The deal is meant to provide clean energy, but it's going to cost a lot of money. The government agreed to pay a certain price for the energy produced by the plant, but the price has gone up a lot since then. This means that people who use electricity will have to pay more for it. The government didn't think about how this would affect people who are already struggling to pay their bills. They also didn't consider other ways to finance the project, which could have made it cheaper for consumers. \n\nThe government's decision has been criticized by a group of MPs, who are saying that the deal is unfair to consumers. They think that the government should have been more careful when making the deal and should have thought about the impact on people's pockets.

As if the risk of waking to find lava lapping at your tent flaps wasn\u2019t enough, tests include monitoring the risks of sickness or suffocation by living near the volcano. One hell of a field trip. Mark Gibbings-Jones Guy Martin vs the Robot Car 9pm, Channel 4 With Guy Martin\u2019s very raison d\u2019\u00eatre threatened by the biggest upheaval in automotive history, he becomes the first man to race against an autonomous racing car, the prototype Roboracer.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Here's a simplified explanation of each program:\n\n1. **Blue Planet II**: This is a documentary series that explores the underwater world. The article mentions that the latest episode is about the \"sunken jungles\" of the ocean, where there are many different types of plants and animals. The article also mentions some specific creatures, like a sea cucumber and a cuttlefish, that are featured in the episode. The documentary is known for its high-quality visuals and interesting stories about the ocean and its inhabitants.\n\nThink of it like a nature documentary, but with a focus on the ocean and its amazing creatures. It's like a big-screen movie, but on TV!\n\n2. **Howards End**: This is a TV adaptation of a classic novel by E.M. Forster. The article mentions that the main character, Margaret, is getting married to a man named Henry. However, their happiness is disrupted by the arrival of a person from Margaret's past, which causes tension in their relationship. The article also mentions that another character, Leonard Bast, is struggling financially and is in a difficult situation.\n\nThink of it like a soap opera, but with a more literary and historical context. It's a story about relationships, family, and social class, set in the early 20th century.\n\n3. **Expedition Volcano**: This is a documentary series that follows a team of scientists as they study a volcano in the Congo. The article mentions that the team is monitoring the risks of living near the volcano, including the risk of getting sick or suffocated by the volcano's gases. The article also mentions that the team is taking risks, such as living near the volcano, to gather data and learn more about the volcano.\n\nThink of it like a science documentary, but with a focus on adventure and exploration. It's like a big-screen movie, but on TV, and it's all about the thrill of discovery and the dangers of working in a challenging environment.\n\n4. **Guy Martin vs the Robot Car**: This is a TV program that features a famous motorcycle rider, Guy Martin, competing against a robot car. The article mentions that the robot car is a prototype called the Roboracer, and that Guy Martin is racing against it. The article also mentions that this is a significant event, as it marks a major change in the automotive industry.\n\nThink of it like a sports documentary, but with a focus on technology and innovation. It's like a big-screen movie, but on TV, and it's all about the excitement of competition and the thrill of watching new technology in action.\n\nIn summary, the text is a summary of four different TV programs that are airing on different channels in the UK. Each program is unique and offers something different, whether it's a nature documentary, a literary drama, a science documentary, or a sports documentary. The text is written in a style that is engaging and easy to understand, making it accessible to a wide range of readers."}

Today, hardly anyone says anything else, not least because virtually all our dire predictions have become realities. Even public officials responsible for running and inspecting the NHS, who couldn\u2019t be seen for dust then (the heads of NHS England, NHS Improvement and the Care Quality Commission), are going public on the gravity of the situation and begging the chancellor to do something in this week\u2019s budget. Indeed, how could anyone say things are OK when, in response to an increase in the past seven years of at most 15% in A&amp;E attendances and admissions, waits in A&amp;E have gone up by 350% and waits for admission by 550%? Increasing waiting times are the canary in the mine. However, the Department of Health, whenever challenged with a another example of increasingly poor performance, excessive waits or other pressures, retorts not that this is incorrect but (without irony) that other things in the NHS are fine. In reality, all is not well. Once again, I am afraid, those who have just started to complain are saying too little and too late. The NHS isn\u2019t getting into crisis, as they cautiously say. It is way beyond that and already failing, despite its internationally accepted efficiency.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Answer with at least 109 words.

The author is saying that two years ago, they were warning that the NHS was in a bad state, but at the time, not many people agreed. Now, however, the situation has become much worse, and almost everyone agrees that the NHS is in crisis. The author is pointing out that the number of people going to the emergency room (A&amp;E) has only increased by 15% over the past seven years, but the waiting times for treatment have increased by 350% and 550% respectively. This is a big problem.\n\n\nThe author is criticizing the Department of Health for not taking the situation seriously. When asked about the problems in the NHS, the department says that some things are fine, but the author disagrees. They think that the NHS is not just in crisis, but is actually failing. The author is saying that people who are just starting to complain about the NHS are too little, too late, and that the situation is much worse than they think.\n\n\nmark my words, the NHS is in a very bad state. The author is not just talking about the waiting times, but also about the overall efficiency of the NHS. They are saying that the NHS is not just inefficient, but is actually failing to provide good healthcare to the people who need it. The author is calling for action to be taken to fix the problems in the NHS, but it's not clear what specific steps they think should be taken.

The disclosure has prompted calls for the regulator to stop companies passing the cost of a discredited medieval practice on to their customers. Ofwat said any firm failing to meet its commitments to customers faced a financial penalty. Dowsers, or water witchers, claim that their divining rods cross over when the presence of water is detected below ground. It is regarded as a pseudoscience, after numerous studies showed it was no better than chance at finding water. Some water companies, however, insisted the practice could be as effective as modern methods. The discovery that firms were still using water diviners was made by the science blogger Sally Le Page, after her parents reported seeing an engineer from Severn Trent \u201cwalking around holding two bent tent pegs to locate a pipe\u201d near their home in Stratford-upon-Avon. Le Page asked Severn Trent why it was still using divining rods to find pipes when there was no evidence that it worked. Replying on Twitter, the company said: \u201cWe\u2019ve found that some of the older methods are just as effective than the new ones, but we do use drones as well, and now satellites.\u201d Le Page then asked the other 11 water companies whether they were using water dowsing.

Recently, it was discovered that 10 of these companies are still using a method called \"water dowsing\" to find underground pipes. Water dowsing is an old practice where people use special rods to try to find water underground. However, many studies have shown that this method doesn't work any better than chance. Some people claim that it does work, but there's no scientific evidence to support this. The water companies are passing the cost of using this method on to their customers, which is not fair. The regulator, Ofwat, has said that if the companies don't meet their commitments to customers, they will face a financial penalty. This means that the companies might have to pay a fine if they continue to use water dowsing.\nP.S. It's worth noting that the article mentions that one water company, Wessex Water, doesn't use water dowsing, and another, Northern Ireland Water, hasn't responded to the inquiry yet.

The chancellor of the exchequer stands up, conjures up the ghost of Sir Stafford Cripps, administers some pain and quickly moves on. In Westminster it is known as aligning the economic and political cycles. In plain English, it means getting the bad news out of the way early in order that there will be money to spare just before voters have to go to the polls again. Only rarely do governments deviate from this approach and when they do it rarely ends well. But these are not normal times. It is simply not possible for Philip Hammond to raise taxes in the hope that, given time, the public will have forgotten all about it. This is a minority government that might not go the distance and, rather like Denis Healey in 1974, Hammond has to prepare for the possibility that there will be another election before too long. What\u2019s more, the reason it might not survive until the scheduled end of the parliament in 2022 is that a good chunk of the public decided in June this year that it wanted more houses built, more money spent on the NHS, less-crowded trains and better roads \u2013 the things Jeremy Corbyn said they could have if the government was prepared to borrow to invest and to tax the rich more heavily. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, thinks the tide turned against austerity during the course of 2016, partly because the public wearied of cuts and partly because Labour articulated an alternative.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

And if there\u2019s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it\u2019s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife\u2019s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: \u201cThe French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths \u2026 the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and \u2026 the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.\u201d As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it\u2019s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served \u201cpullet with some prunes in the broth\u201d at a knight\u2019s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe \u2013 even (horror!) south of the border. Happily for us, however, this particular version remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls \u201can auld boiling fowl\u201d (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that \u201cattempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit\u201d, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using \u201ca more flavourful pheasant or other game bird \u2013 cock or hen \u2013 which has roamed freely\u201d. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character. Feel free to use pheasant here, if that\u2019s what you have, but chicken, to some extent the older the better, remains the classic choice.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It's a hearty and wholesome dish that's perfect for the holiday season. The author mentions that Scotland is famous for its soups and broths, and this particular recipe has been around since the 16th century. However, the author notes that it's hard to find a good, old-fashioned chicken to use in the recipe, so they recommend using a more flavorful game bird like pheasant instead.

In a statement, the CBS News president, David Rhodes, said his behavior was \u201cextremely disturbing and intolerable\u201d. \u201cWhat may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable.\u201d Rose said in a statement on Monday: \u201cI am greatly embarrassed.

I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\u201d Asked if he has anything to say to the women who had accused him of \u201cwrongdoings\u201d, he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not wrongdoings.\u201d Co-hosts of CBS This Morning Gayle King and Norah O\u2019Donnell presented the show without their usual third team member, Rose, on Tuesday and broke away from their normal news reporting style to give raw, personal opinions on the behavior alleged against him. \u201cThis is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and, more generally, the safety of women,\u201d O\u2019Donnell began. The show had opened with a straight news report on a story that now involved their own station. A CBS This Morning reporter related the facts that Rose, 75, had been suspended from his job while the company looks into detailed accusations from eight women that he had made unwanted sexual advances towards them, as revealed by the Washington Post. Allegations include lewd phone calls, walking around naked in their presence, or groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas, and the women were employees or aspired to work for Rose at the Charlie Rose show from the late 1990s to 2011, the Post reported. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage for these women to come forward,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

This happened after several women came forward and accused him of behaving in a way that made them feel uncomfortable or even hurt. They said he made unwanted advances, like calling them in a way that was not respectful, walking around naked in front of them, or touching them in a way that was not okay.\nThe women who accused Charlie Rose of this behavior worked with him or wanted to work with him on his TV show. They said these things happened between the late 1990s and 2011. The company, CBS News, is now investigating these claims. They suspended Charlie Rose from his job while they look into what happened. This means he is not working right now, but he might be able to go back to his job if the investigation finds that he did not do anything wrong.\nThe people who work with Charlie Rose on his TV show, like his co-hosts Gayle King and Norah O'Donnell, were very upset by the allegations. They talked about how important it is for women to feel safe and respected. They said it takes a lot of courage for the women who accused Charlie Rose to come forward and share their stories. This means they are proud of the women for being brave and speaking out.\nThe TV show, CBS This Morning, talked about the situation on the air. They had a reporter explain what happened, and then they had a discussion about the importance of respecting women and making sure they feel safe. The co-hosts also talked about how they feel about the situation and how they want to support the women who were affected by Charlie Rose's behavior.\n*** \nP.S.

Her shows, for all their simplicity, can be hard to pin down, but her words are telling: \u201cI\u2019m always looking for the heart of a story,\u201d she says. This is a director who deals in feelings. To those not paying attention, Cookson landed like a bolt from the blue. Most directors cut through in their 30s, but she was in her 50s when her circus-heavy staging of Jacqueline Wilson\u2019s Hetty Feather was nominated for an Olivier award in 2015. Her calling card, however, was a magnificent, two-part Jane Eyre, a total theatre treat that translated Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s book into movement and music, colour and light. Since its premiere at the Bristol Old Vic in 2014, more than 250,000 people have seen it on stage or on screen \u2013 possibly unprecedented for a piece of devised theatre. It\u2019s why, last year, Cookson got the National Theatre\u2019s Olivier stage for Christmas \u2013 arguably the biggest family slot of the year \u2013 to put on Peter Pan. This year, as a mark of her newfound bankability, Marianne Elliott\u2019s new commercial company has backed her to bring Narnia to life in Leeds. The West Yorkshire Playhouse has even boosted its capacity for the purpose, transforming its 750-seat amphitheatre into a vast, 1,000-plus theatre in the round.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness \u2013 but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness \u2013 while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. \u201cFrom a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease \u2013 but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,\u201d said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed \u2013 an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

She moved into my flat in Paddington about 27 years ago, and the stockings began. The first exchange would have definitely included an avocado or mango Body Shop body butter. My all-time favourite item from Sali was a Brenda from Beverly Hills 90210 action figure; we were obsessed with the show, and with Brenda in particular, so this was a massive score. It\u2019s not about being grand and spendy. My biggest thrill is finding some gorgeous three-quid lip balm that has flown below her radar. That is the ultimate achievement.

A GP practice manager for much of my early working life, I had taken a step back to raise my daughter. In 2003, Dad\u2019s health deteriorated, with heart problems and Parkinson\u2019s disease. My siblings helped and visited him when they could but I lived the closest and had more time, so it made sense for me to help out the most. I\u2019d always thought of care as helping people who need to be taken to the toilet or helped into bed each evening. What I was doing was sitting and talking, going to the supermarket or helping with housework. What I didn\u2019t see at that time was the truth in front of me, that I had actually been delivering relationship-led care and companionship. I feel privileged to have spent that time caring for Dad, and in many ways I got to know more about him over those five years than I might otherwise have done. It came completely naturally to me, but in my mind being a care worker was something very different, so after Dad passed away and I felt ready to get back to work, I discounted it. I had a strong CV after my time in the NHS and felt ready for a new role.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Entire output should be wrapped in JSON format.

After all, anyone who can read the book in Scots will already be able to read it in English. This is not just a translation, though. Matthew Fitt, the translator, has applied a defibrillator to Rowling\u2019s flatlined text and made it come alive. Take the introduction of Harry\u2019s uncle, Mr Dursley.

For example, instead of saying 'Mr. Dursley is the director of a firm that makes drills', the translator says 'Mr. Dursley is the \"heidbummer\"'. The translator has also used Scots words to describe the weather, like 'cranreuch' which means 'cold'. The article is saying that this new version of the book is not just a translation, but a new and improved version that brings the story to life in a more interesting way.

Shortly before legislators met, the man expected to succeed him broke more than a week of silence to add his voice to those calling for the ageing leader to step down. Emmerson Mnangagwa, until recently Mugabe\u2019s vice-president and right hand man, urged the nonagenarian leader to \u201caccept the will of the people\u201d.

Yet from poinsettias to potted Christmas trees, many of these festive favourites can be extremely hard to keep alive in the conditions of the average living room for just a few weeks, let alone year to year. There is, however, a really old-school, and often overlooked, seasonal houseplant that is made from much tougher stuff: the beautiful and exotic Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata and S x buckleyi). These two species (which look so similar that they share a common name) hail from the cool mountains of southeastern Brazil, where they are pollinated by hummingbirds. Unusually for a cactus, they aren\u2019t a desert plant, but have adapted to grow on the boughs of tall rainforest trees, festooning their branches with weeping foliage and dazzling flowers. This relatively cool-weather habitat is surprisingly similar to the conditions of our British living rooms, making them perfectly adapted to thrive in hanging baskets or trail over windowsills everywhere. But what does a cactus have to do with Christmas? Not a great deal, really. In fact, in their native habitat their winter-flowering period doesn\u2019t even coincide with Christmas. However, fortunately for gardeners like me, their habit of bursting into the most spectacular of floral displays from November to January occurs just when I need it most.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The article is talking about the UK's Brexit negotiations with the European Union (EU). The UK's government, led by Prime Minister Theresa May, has agreed to pay a large amount of money to the EU as part of the Brexit deal. The amount is expected to be around \u00a340 billion, which is a lot of money. However, the article suggests that the final bill could be even higher, around \u00a380 billion. This is a big deal because the UK's government has been saying that leaving the EU would save them money, which they could then use to fund the National Health Service (NHS). But it seems that's not going to happen. Instead, the UK will have to pay a lot of money to the EU, which could be a problem for the NHS. The article also mentions that the UK's government is trying to avoid telling the public how much they will really have to pay, because they think it would be unpopular. They are trying to soften the blow by saying that the money will come with conditions, such as the EU agreeing to a good trade deal. The article suggests that this could be a way to break the deadlock in the Brexit talks, but it's not clear if it will work. The article is like a box that contains a lot of complex information, and it's hard to know what's inside until the negotiations are over. It's like trying to predict the weather on a given day, it's hard to know what will happen. The article also mentions that the EU countries are waiting for \"sufficient progress\" to be made on three key issues: money, citizens' rights, and Ireland. It's like a gene that determines the outcome of the negotiations, and it's not clear what the result will be. The article is trying to explain the routine of the Brexit negotiations, but it's a complex and confusing process. The article is like a soft blanket that tries to make the situation seem less complicated, but it's still a difficult issue to understand. Is there anything else I can help with? \\n\\n"}
