I\u2019ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself \u2013 I was already out of kids\u2019 books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren\u2019t enough to tempt me back \u2013 but I\u2019d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn\u2019t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children\u2019s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug \u2013 just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden\u2019s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the \u201cHarry Potter effect\u201d in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children\u2019s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth \u00a320bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son\u2019s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed \u201cexperiences\u201d and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The author admires JK Rowling's work and is pleased to see her son reading the books. However, the author is also aware of the commercialization of the series, with a multibillion-pound industry capitalizing on the franchise.\n\n*** The author notes that the children who are reading Harry Potter today are different from those who first read the series 20 years ago. They are immediately exposed to a vast marketing machine that sells Potter-themed experiences and merchandise. This is a departure from the original readers who were not bombarded with commercialization. The author seems to be lamenting the loss of the original magic of the series, which has been overshadowed by the commercialization of the franchise."}

If you'd like, I can provide a hypothetical response to the scenario, but it would not be based on the original text. Let me know if you'd like me to proceed.  P.S.  I can provide a hypothetical response to the scenario. If Oumuamua is found to be broadcasting extraterrestrial radio signals, it would be a historic moment that could potentially change our understanding of the universe. In this scenario, scientists would likely work together to analyze the signals and determine their origin and purpose. Governments and international organizations might also become involved to discuss the implications and potential responses to this discovery. The public would likely be fascinated and concerned, leading to a global discussion about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and its potential impact on human society.  P.S.

As for pregnancy and the weeks around childbirth, finances are no more a problem than outside this period: precarious households are still struggling, but not more than before, and well-off households remain well off. If we look at how supported a mother is, however \u2013 well, nothing is planned to help the young mother. Paternity leave lasts only 11 days, which is not even enough for mothers to recover from childbirth. Young mothers must therefore manage the daily, non-stop demands of their new life while they try and heal. They must also seek childcare, knowing that programs proposed by the state are not sufficient, especially in the Paris region. The cost of child care varies greatly. In daycare centers, the less well-off households can get by for \u20ac1,000 ($1,177.59) per year \u2013 but there is only one place for every eight children.

As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence.

Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely. And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman\u2019s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training.

Roughly the length of War and Peace, The House of Government aims to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through a building and its residents, via a study in eschatology \u2013 the creation of an apocalyptic cult, its unexpected success, and its equally unexpected failure. It is a dizzying book, a hall of mirrors, panoramic and bizarre, as puzzlingly esoteric and thrillingly fervent as the doctrines it describes. Whether it succeeds in what it tries to do \u2013 essentially, to write a totally new history of the Russian revolution, cast in the mould of a teeming historical novel \u2013 is questionable. That there is nothing else like it is indisputable. We should begin where the author does not, with the building. Slezkine is best known to non-specialists for The Jewish Century, a lively revisionist history that placed the Soviet Union at the heart of 20th-century Jewish experience, but in the academy he might be better known for his essay The USSR as a Communal Apartment, a pivotal study of Soviet multinationalism through the spatial/architectural metaphor of a crowded, thinly subdivided \u201ckommunalka\u201d flat. The House of Government was another, larger block of flats, completed in 1931, \u201ca place where revolutionaries came home and the revolution came to die\u201d. It was designed in the late 1920s by the architect Boris Iofan for the Soviet elite. Its tenants were decimated in the Great Purge, leading to the later nickname \u201cthe House of Preliminary Detention\u201d.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

It's a long and complex book that tries to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through the story of a building and its residents. The author, Slezkine, is known for his previous work \"The Jewish Century\" and an essay called \"The USSR as a Communal Apartment\". In this new book, he explores the history of the Russian revolution in a unique way. The building in question, the House of Government, was designed for the Soviet elite and was completed in 1931. It was a place where revolutionaries lived and the revolution ultimately came to an end. The tenants of the building were severely affected during the Great Purge. The book is a panoramic and bizarre account of the history of Bolshevism, and its success is questionable. However, it's undeniable that there's nothing else like it.

{"follow_all_instructions": true, "follow_instruction_list": [true], "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_content:postscript"], "prompt": "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron\u2019s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week\u2019s climate change summit in Paris, May said: \u201cThere is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.\u201d She described coal as \u201cone of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power\u201d and hailed the \u201cenormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents\u201d. May\u2019s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists \u201ctackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world\u2019s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces\u201d. At the summit she will announce a \u00a3140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus \u00a315m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May\u2019s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.S.", "question_id": "aa6540d84727f181cd4cd261eaaa91a039e25de432215acdea05f7fb3236349e", "response": "Here's a paraphrased version of the news article:\n\nTheresa May has emphasized the importance of addressing climate change, particularly in helping poorer countries that are most vulnerable to its effects. In an article for the Guardian, she highlighted the need for developed economies like the UK to take action. May has pledged \u00a3140m to support communities affected by climate change and \u00a315m for reconstruction efforts in Dominica, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria. This move comes as the Conservative party tries to improve its image on environmental issues, following internal polling that showed younger voters are increasingly concerned about the environment. The party has faced criticism for its stance on issues like foxhunting, the ivory trade, and animal welfare, but has since backtracked on these positions.\n\nP.S. It's worth noting that while May's commitment to climate change is a positive step, her party's past actions and controversies on environmental issues have raised questions about the sincerity of their efforts. The party's efforts to improve its image on environmental issues may be seen as a tactical move to appeal to younger voters, rather than a genuine shift in policy.

Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied. Assad\u2019s departure from office, long demanded by western powers, is no longer on the immediate agenda.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 1 paragraphs.

He tells me there is \u201ca ton of research\u201d to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. \u201cThere are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,\u201d he says.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10\u2019s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of \u201cHenry VIII powers\u201d, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the \u201cserious flaws\u201d in the deal, or he would \u201cterminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington\u2019s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement.

However, the National Basketball Association (NBA) is gaining ground and may eventually surpass the National Football League (NFL) in popularity. The NBA's recent success, including a record-breaking 20.4 million viewers for the 2017 NBA finals, is a sign that the league is gaining an edge over the NFL. Despite the NFL's massive audience of 111 million for the 2016 Super Bowl, the NBA's steady growth suggests that it may be the league of the future. The article emphasizes that the shift in popularity is not due to the athletes themselves, but rather the symbolic meaning that sports take on in American culture. Just as a passenger on a bus may get off at a stop that's not their final destination, the popularity of sports can change over time. The article suggests that the NBA's growing popularity is a kiss of death for the NFL, but this is not necessarily the case. The NFL still has a strong following and is unlikely to disappear anytime soon. However, the NBA's success may give it an edge in the long run. The article concludes that the popularity of sports is a complex issue that involves more than just the athletes themselves. It's like trying to wear a bag on your head - it's a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n* The NBA's growing popularity is a sign that the league is gaining an edge over the NFL.\n* The NFL's massive audience for the 2016 Super Bowl is not enough to guarantee its continued popularity.\n* The popularity of sports is a complex issue that involves more than just the athletes themselves.\n\nP.S. The article's prediction that the NBA will surpass the NFL in popularity is not necessarily a bad thing for the NFL. It may simply mean that the league needs to adapt and evolve to stay relevant in a changing sports landscape. Just as a passenger on a bus may need to get off at a new stop, the NFL may need to adjust its strategy to stay competitive. The article's prediction is a reminder that the popularity of sports is always subject to change, and that leagues and teams need to be prepared to adapt in order to stay ahead of the curve."}

Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters \u2013 and, indeed, all clothing except a hat \u2013 to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the \u201cmost disgusting programme ever shown\u201d on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into \u201cBrucie\u201d, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became \u201cCheggers\u201d. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children\u2019s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children\u2019s presenters \u2013 becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic \u2013 Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV \u2013 appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef \u2013 Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais\u2019s Extras and Life\u2019s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino\u2019s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government\u2019s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, \u201c500 people died because a suitable organ was not available.

This move aims to address the issue of people dying due to a lack of available organs. The government wants to change the conversation around organ donation, making it easier for people to discuss their wishes with family and friends. The consultation will ask three questions:\n* How much say should families have in their deceased relative's decision to donate their organs?\n* When would exemptions to the opt-out system be needed?\n* What safeguards will be necessary to ensure that people's wishes are respected?\nThe government hopes that this new system will increase the number of available organs for transplantation, saving more lives. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is urging people to overcome their reluctance to discuss organ donation and have their say in the consultation. This is a significant step towards changing the NHS organ donation programme, which has been a topic of discussion for some time. The government is working to create a new structure for organ donation, one that will make it easier for people to donate and for families to make informed decisions about their loved ones' wishes.\u201d"}

Nor is it in that horrible quasi-sheen that we associate with surviving terrible loss. It\u2019s not in the lifestyle choices she made \u2013 living in New York one year, relocating to a home right on a California beach another \u2013 and it\u2019s not in the interactions she had with Hollywood royalty, from Warren Beatty (who had a crush on her) to Harrison Ford (who worked as her carpenter for a time). It does not lie in the era-defining work she published in the 1960s and 70s, solo or co-written with husband John Gregory Dunne. No, the glamour of Joan Didion is merely in her willingness to try things. Truly, there is nothing more luxe than that: the decision to dip your toe, your foot, your leg and eventually your enitre body into a new endeavour, and just do it. In Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold, a Netflix documentary produced and directed by Didion\u2019s nephew, the actor Griffin Dunne \u2013 the writer is endlessly watchable. She is still a sure speaker, and her hands dance in front of her when she\u2019s being emphatic. But it\u2019s all the stories she pursued, the diversifying of her skill set, from magazines to screenplays, as well as the journey into motherhood: all those opportunities grabbed at, with both hands, that really seize you.

Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e as France\u2019s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s praise of her as \u201cthis beautiful creature who can wear anything\u201d; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode\u2019s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song\u2019s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni\u2019s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson\u2019s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed\u2019s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song\u2019s dark soul.

Ten-year-old Emily told them a boy at school had slapped her, hard, across the face: \u201cI want to die. Nobody believes me. He\u2019s hitting me and nobody believes me.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Rob tells me, his voice echoing the helplessness and frustration he felt. \u201cHearing her say those words \u2013 what parent wants to hear that from their 10-year-old daughter?\u201d When Claire tried to speak to the school about the incident, they quickly dismissed it as \u201ca misunderstanding\u201d, telling her: \u201cEveryone\u2019s happy now.\u201d But Emily was far from happy. Over the subsequent two weeks, she gradually opened up to her parents with the help of her GP. Slowly, she described how the boy in question had sexually harassed and assaulted her over the past 10 months. It emerged that another child had made a detailed report to the school after witnessing the boy intimidating and assaulting Emily. The classmate had told staff it happened in a corner of the playground known as the \u201csex corner\u201d, where the boy had forced Emily against a wall, pinning her hands on either side of her as he gyrated and rubbed his body against hers. Emily closed her eyes and started crying.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['initiative', 'jacket', 'person', 'picture', 'world'] in the response.

She confided in her parents about the incident, expressing her desire to die due to the trauma she experienced.\n\n**Section 2**\nEmily's parents were initially unaware of the extent of the abuse and were told by the school that it was a \"misunderstanding.\" However, with the help of her GP, Emily gradually opened up about the abuse, which had been ongoing for 10 months.\n\n**Section 3**\nA classmate of Emily's had previously reported the abuse to the school, describing the boy's behavior as intimidating and assaultive. The incident occurred in a designated area of the playground known as the \"sex corner.\"\n\n**Section 4**\nThe abuse was characterized by the boy forcing Emily against a wall, pinning her hands, and rubbing his body against hers. Emily's experience highlights the need for schools to take a proactive initiative in addressing and preventing such incidents.\n\n**Section 5**\nThis case serves as a reminder that children are vulnerable and need protection from abuse. It also underscores the importance of creating a safe and supportive environment in schools, where students feel comfortable reporting incidents without fear of judgment or retaliation.

However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg\u2019s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh\u2019s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott\u2019s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins\u2019s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

However, it faces stiff competition from other films, including Steven Spielberg's The Post and Martin McDonagh's Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The nominations reflect a changed landscape in Hollywood, following the recent allegations of sexual abuse against producer Harvey Weinstein. Notably, none of Weinstein's films received nominations, but Ridley Scott's All the Money in the World, which replaced Kevin Spacey after he was accused of misconduct, did receive multiple nominations. Despite expectations, the list of nominees did not show a significant shift towards more female-led films. Notably, female directors were overlooked, and Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman was entirely snubbed. The Shape of Water leads the pack with 7 nominations, including best picture, director, and actress, as well as supporting actor and actress nominations.\n\nP.P.S. The article highlights the ongoing impact of the #MeToo movement on the film industry, with many nominees and winners being recognized for their work in films that address themes of feminism and social justice. The Shape of Water, in particular, has been praised for its portrayal of a strong female protagonist and its exploration of themes such as love, acceptance, and empowerment. The film's success is seen as a testament to the power of storytelling to bring about positive change and to challenge societal norms.

The Shape of Water is widely regarded as a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling, and its nominations are a testament to its enduring impact and influence.  The article concludes by noting that the Golden Globes ceremony will provide a platform for the entertainment industry to respond to the ongoing crisis in Hollywood and to celebrate the work of artists who are pushing the boundaries of storytelling and challenging societal norms.  The Shape of Water's nominations are a significant step forward in this process, and its success is seen as a beacon of hope for a more inclusive and equitable film industry.

The teacher asks her pupils to imitate the style of Vassily Kandinsky. The students mimic Kandinsky\u2019s geometric abstractions, mastering brushwork and learning colour theory. If that was all there were to the lesson, it would be a hands-on class in art history. But the art teacher asks the students to cut up their paintings and build 3D sculptures out of the pieces. They have all started with the same source, but their works all end up looking extremely different: some rise straight up in a column, while others are a jigsaw of different forms and angles. The students learn to treat the past not as a landing point, but as a launching pad. Creativity does not emerge out of thin air. Instead, it is a process of derivation and extrapolation. No idea is ever wholly original; there is always a link from the known to the new.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Your response should contain at least 18 sentences.

The students are tasked with creating paintings in Kandinsky's geometric abstraction style, which involves mastering brushwork and learning about color theory. This lesson is not just about art history, but it's also about understanding the process of creativity. The teacher asks the students to take their paintings to the next level by cutting them up and building 3D sculptures out of the pieces. This exercise shows that even when starting from the same source, the final products can be vastly different. Some students create sculptures that rise straight up in a column, while others create jigsaw-like structures with different forms and angles. This exercise teaches the students to view the past as a launching pad for new ideas, rather than just a destination. The students learn that creativity is not about coming up with entirely new ideas, but rather about building upon existing ones. Creativity is a process of derivation and extrapolation, where new ideas are derived from existing ones and then taken to new heights. No idea is ever completely original, as there is always a link between the known and the new. This concept is often referred to as the \"derivative\" nature of creativity. The students are learning to see the past as a source of inspiration, rather than just a source of information. By building upon existing ideas, the students are able to create something new and original. This process of derivation and extrapolation is a key part of the creative process. It allows artists to take existing ideas and turn them into something new and innovative. The students are learning to think creatively and to see the world in a new way. They are learning to take risks and to experiment with new ideas. The teacher is guiding the students through this process, providing them with the tools and the support they need to succeed. The students are learning to be open-minded and to be willing to try new things. They are learning to see the value in taking risks and in experimenting with new ideas. By doing so, they are able to tap into their own creativity and to bring new ideas to life. The process of derivation and extrapolation is a powerful tool for creativity, and it's one that the students are learning to harness. It's a process that allows them to build upon existing ideas and to create something new and original. It's a process that requires patience, persistence, and practice, but it's one that can lead to incredible results.

A full house at the Allianz Stadium and the atmosphere crackling as Juventus fans put on their usual pre-game choreography: a sea of black and white placards broken only by a green, white and red tricolore to remind everyone this is where the reigning champions reside. Well, no, actually, that wouldn\u2019t quite do it. Ultras also prepared their own banner, in which 1970s cartoon detective Nick Carter was seen, together with sidekicks Patsy and Ten, examining a map of Europe. Italy had been blocked out in black and white stripes. Above the picture was a message aimed at Inter\u2019s owners: \u201cThe wise man says, \u2018China is close, Italy is a mirage\u2019.\u201d Inevitable jibes aside, there was nervousness among the home fans as well. They might not like to admit it in Turin but, for the first time in a long time, Inter are a genuine threat. Only four games shy of the season\u2019s midway stage, indeed, the Nerazzurri were top. They arrived unbeaten, and with fresh legs, too, on account of not playing in European competition.

The fans are displaying their usual pre-game choreography, but there's a sense of nervousness among them, as Inter is a genuine threat to Juventus' dominance. The article mentions that Inter is top of the league, unbeaten, and has fresh legs due to not playing in European competition. The mention of a \"lake\" is not present in the article, but the \"wise man\" quote mentions \"China\" and \"Italy\" in a metaphorical sense, implying a sense of distance or separation. The \"exchange\" between the fans and the opposing team's owners is a jibe, a lighthearted insult, aimed at Inter's owners. The \"reaction\" of the fans is one of nervousness, and the \"sound\" of the atmosphere is described as \"crackling.\" The \"adult\" theme of the article is the competitive nature of the match and the tension between the two teams. However, the article does not mention any of the keywords ['adult', 'exchange', 'lake','reaction','sound'] directly.

She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called \u201cautobiographophobia\u201d, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one\u2019s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name \u201cstories\u201d very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. \u201cPilgrimage\u201d, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag\u2019s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had \u201conly sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.\u201d The next piece, \u201cProject for a Trip to China\u201d, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag\u2019s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Her writing often explored complex themes such as camp, photography, and illness. Despite her impressive body of work, Sontag was not a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form as a way to avoid writing about her personal life, a fear she shared with the Russian writer Anton Chekhov. Chekhov referred to this fear as \"autobiographophobia.\" Sontag found that writing short stories allowed her to explore her life indirectly, which was helpful in avoiding this fear.\n\nThe book in question is a collection of Sontag's short stories, many of which are autobiographical. The first story, \"Pilgrimage,\" is a memoir of Sontag's youth in southern California. It recounts her visit to the home of the aging writer Thomas Mann, which was a disappointing experience. The story is notable for its use of dialogue, which reveals Sontag's complex emotions and thoughts.\n\nThe second story, \"Project for a Trip to China,\" is also a memoir. It provides insight into Sontag's childhood, including her love of reading and her habit of ordering exotic foods in restaurants. The story is experimental in style, using lists, tables, and negative statements to convey its themes.\n\nHere are some key points about Sontag's writing:\n\n* Sontag's writing often explored complex themes such as camp, photography, and illness.\n* She turned to short-story writing as a way to avoid writing about her personal life.\n\nSome notable features of Sontag's writing include:\n\n* Her use of dialogue to convey complex emotions and thoughts.\n* Her experimental style, which often incorporates lists, tables, and negative statements.\n* Her ability to explore her life indirectly through her writing, which allowed her to avoid her fear of writing about her personal life.  \u2022 Her writing often provided insight into her childhood and personal experiences.  \u2022 Her use of

There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what\u2019s left? Actually, this year there\u2019s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it\u2019s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the \u201cflexitarian\u201d means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it\u2019s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there\u2019s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made \u2013 use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you\u2019re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range\u2019s new \u201croast beef\u201d joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry\u2019s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky\u2019s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

This showcases his interest in language and its connection to place.\n\nDavies's approach to writing is similar to that of Goethe's \"school of seeing.\" He aims to tell a story that is both informative and engaging. His use of digression, detective work, and humor adds to the book's appeal. The book is a result of Davies's many years of experience as a historian and academic, and it is evident in the depth and breadth of his knowledge.\n\nWall to wall, Davies's book is a testament to his passion for history, literature, and travel. His unique approach to storytelling and his use of language make the book a compelling read. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in history, culture, and the human experience.

With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual \u201cfree markets are great\u201d rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: \u201cActively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.\u201d This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on \u201cbudget responsibility\u201d.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual\u2019s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also \u201cmeeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.\u201d The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father\u2019s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have \u201cany involvement or association whatsoever\u201d with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than \u201ctraditional\u201d Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead\u2019s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court\u2019s master, Craig Sanderson, said would \u201cnot fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community\u201d. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright\u2019s estate, acting on behalf of Wright\u2019s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson\u2019s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: \u201cThe exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.\u201d In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of \u201cmaterial errors\u201d in calculating the size of Mead\u2019s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted \u201cproper maintenance\u201d and that the initial finding that Mead was \u201chonest\u201d and \u201cnot a gold-digger\u201d were not relevant. \u201cThe capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,\u201d the appeal court\u2019s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Mead, the daughter of a mining billionaire, had challenged her father's will, arguing that it did not provide enough for her needs. The original will left her a $3 million trust fund, but she was granted $25 million by the court in 2015. However, the estate of Mead's father appealed the decision, and the court has now overturned it. The appeal court found that the original judge made errors in calculating the size of Mead's inheritance. The court stated that the inheritance should be enough for Mead to buy a substantial house and invest the rest to provide a reasonable income for the rest of her life. Mead's inheritance was reduced due to the court's decision, which was made in favor of Mead's older half-siblings from her father's second marriage. The court's decision was based on the idea that Mead's inheritance should be sufficient to meet her basic needs, rather than providing her with a large sum of money.\nP.S. The court's decision may have significant implications for Mead's financial situation and her relationship with her family.

Lu Wei was the powerful and flamboyant head of the Cyberspace Administration of China from 2014 until June 2016 and he came to personify China\u2019s model for internet control. He travelled to the United States, meeting with the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon and Apple, and held court when tech titans visited China. Lu was being investigated for \u201cserious disciplinary violations\u201d, a euphemism for graft, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on its website. He stepped down from running the Cyberspace Administration in 2016, leading to rumours he had fallen out of favour. President Xi Jinping has led a far reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power five years ago and has said graft is the paramount threat to the ruling Communist party. The campaign has seen nearly 1.4m party members punished and Xi vowed to continue rooting out graft during his second five-year term which began last month. Critics say elements of the anti-graft campaign have been used to eliminate Xi\u2019s enemies and root out political factions that oppose him. Lu is the most prominent official to fall since Xi\u2019s second term began and the anti-corruption agency pointed to Lu\u2019s case as a sign the drive will continue. \u201cLu Wei being investigated by the organisation is the best proof of this determination and resolve,\u201d the agency said in a commentary.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Hammond is under pressure to balance the needs of Brexit supporters with the demands of voters who want improved housing affordability, education, and healthcare. According to Rafael Behr, Hammond's predicament is that he must 'build houses, but not in anyone's backyard' and 'raise revenue, but not from taxes.' The article suggests that Hammond's handling of his job is making it harder for himself, with one Conservative source stating that 'he's got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself.' The article also mentions the death of David Cassidy, the star of The Partridge Family, who died at the age of 67 after being hospitalized for kidney and liver failure. The article is written in a neutral tone, but the feeling of the article is one of skepticism towards Hammond's ability to meet the challenges ahead. The author, Warren Murray, is not taking a seat of judgment, but rather presenting the facts and allowing the reader to form their own opinion.
