But we don't know anything about the person at the city hall, so we can't determine if the person at the zoo is telling the truth.\n* If the person at the zoo lies, then the person at the city hall lies (from 1). But we don't know anything about the person at the city hall, so we can't determine if the person at the zoo is lying.\n* The person at the aquarium says the person at the vineyard tells the truth (from 2). But we know from (5) that the person at the vineyard is lying, so the person at the aquarium must be lying.\n* The person at the vineyard says the person at the movie theater tells the truth (from 12). But we know from (5) that the person at the vineyard is lying, so the person at the movie theater must be lying.\n* The person at the beach says the person at the zoo tells the truth (from 8). But we know from (10) that the person at the zoo says the person at the aquarium tells the truth, and we know from (2) that the person at the aquarium says the person at the vineyard tells the truth. Since the person at the vineyard is lying (from 5), the person at the aquarium must be lying, and the person at the zoo must be lying.\n\nTherefore, the person at the zoo tells the truth: **no**.\nThe person at the aquarium tells the truth: **no**.\nThe person at the vineyard tells the truth: **no**."]}], "tstamp": 1737452116.3898876}
